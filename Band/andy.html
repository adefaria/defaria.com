Equipment: People ask me what I think about when I'm playing.  Well I think
about what I'm playing, of course.  Then I think about how much I'm getting
paid.  Then with some quick arithmetic I determine how much per note I'm
getting paid and adjust my playing accordingly!  I play a Steinberger guitar
mainly and an Ovation acoustic.  I use a Korg A3 effects processor that STacy
changes at the right time and Ada speakers and amps. I really like the
Steinberger but it must be an irregular because I haven't been able to find
the head piece since I bought it!  Luckily it doesn' t go out of tune often.
