Mike Fraser plays primarily bass in the band (occasionally acoustic guitar)
and was our lead vocalist as well as keyboardist. This was made possible by
the fact that the band ran a MIDI sequencer to play all the keyboard parts as
well as other things like a sampler and even ran the light show on occasion!<p>

Equipment: Well let's see... my finger strikes the string and the magnetic
coil picks up the vibes - it goes through the wire and into the box... and
then, a low rumble comes out of a cardboard speaker.  Ha! Moosic! Actually, if
you want to be more technical, I use Fender bass guitars, a Peavey amp with
Acoustic speakers (Peavey?), Kawai & Korg keyboards (that I hardly ever play
because the computer does that!).  Too bad we couldn't roll a Baby Grand on
stage every night! (I probably wouldn't play it either).  When do I get
paid!?!?!<p>
