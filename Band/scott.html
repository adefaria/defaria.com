Scott Dinn was the drummer but he had his hands full. Scott was responsible
for running the sequencer and staying on time with that ever present click
track in his monitor. Scott also had a bag of tricks in a rack including the
sampler and a DrumKAT which he used to trigger sounds, both musical and some
not so musical ones like samples of Beavis and Butthead!

Equipment: Hmmmm, where do I start??  Do I tell you about my 9 piece Tama
Granstar Custom drums, with a Cherry Wine finish, with lots of Zildjian
cymbals or do I first tell you about my electronic stuff like my Atari STacy
laptop computer that's used to sequence all the keyboards, lights, and signal
processors and my drumKAT that I trigger an Alesis D4 drum module and a Peavey
SP sampler to get all those crazy sounds... I just don't know where to begin!
Maybe I should tell you about the promark 747 rock nylon tip oak sticks I use?
Naw, that's too boring... What about all the gates, compressors, microphones,
mixer and all the miles of MIDI cables that I use to keep track of all my
drums and sound modules?  That's not really worth mentioning either... Oh
forget it... Let's just say I have a lot of stuff!  Anyone wanna help me tear
down tonight!?!?!
