# PJJ NOTE ON THE ABOVE COMMAND:
#
# By including only hfs and vxfs filesystems, we avoid descending NFS or
MVFS
# (ClearCase) mount points.  We don't use "! -fstype nfs" -- that would
still
# descend NFS mounts, looking for HFS/VxFS mounted underneath.  One could
# argue that it's preferable to do something like
#
#    find / \( -fstype nfs -o -fstype mvfs \) -prune -o -mtime +3 ...
#
# (i.e., only list filesystem types to exclude), but the mention of mvfs
# would cause the command to fail on hosts which don't have ClearCase.
