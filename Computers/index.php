  <h2>Career (brief history)</h2>

  <p>I have been involved with computers for as long as I can
  remember.  Way back in high school, when computers were just
  starting to be widely used in business, my interests in math lead me
  to explore the field of computes. Starting in a class using punched
  cards and paper tape I was lucky that my high school was one of the
  few schools that had a class in data processing and access to real
  computers, though they were miles away we had access via a teletype.</p>

  <p>I went to college to be a "computer scientist" but is was really
  just business programming. Still I learned standard COBOL, FORTRAN
  and Assembler on an old, card munching IBM 360 mainframe. From there
  I got a job as a computer operator for a small market research firm
  on an HP/3000 machine. Even though I was an operator I used my
  programming skills to write a few applications in FORTRAN and
  learned SPL (System Programming Language) on my own. I did not know
  it but my involvement in HP equipment and HP itself would continue
  to this day.</p>

  <p>From there I moved to various business programming positions and
  started consulting, writing COBOL, View (screen forms package) and
  Image (database) applications for business on HP systems for some 8
  years.</p>

  <p>In 1987 I moved to California when I got a contract at HP
  Cupertino itself performing testing. After a while I joined HP as a
  permenant employee and was soon reorganized into the Language Labs
  at HP. I was trained and took to HP-UX and within a short time I
  became the Clearcase and Unix administrator for the entire lab of
  some 80-120 engineers. I left HP in 1998 after 10 years.</p>

  <p>Since leaving HP I had contracts as such noname companies in
  Silicon Valley like Sun and Cisco and then back into HP itself.</p>

  <p>Then, as everybody knows, the Internet bubble burst and I eventually 
  hooked up with a start up company, Salira Optical Network System, where I
  am today</p>

  <p>Next on tap, with Salira on the verge of bankruptcy I took a
  contract down in Orange County at Ameriquest Mortgage. LA was nice
  but my family is up here. After a while at Ameriquest I get a job at
  LynuxWorks in San Jose. Ah, working on Linux was nice. But soon it
  was back to contracting for me, now at Broadcom.</p>

  <p>Please refer to my <a href="/resume">resume</a> for a detailed
  listing of my work history.</p>

  <h2><a name="gear"></a>Gear</h2>

  <p>My site is hosted at my home through an always on
  DSL connection. It used to run on my <a
  href="http://microsoft.com/windowsxp">Windows XP</a> box, a 5 year
  old 450 Mhz machine that's still kicking and provided a lot of
  service. Being brought up on <span class="standout">Unix</span> I am
  more comfortable at programming in a <i>Unix mode</i>. As such I
  have discovered and utilize <a href="http://cygwin.com">Cygwin</a>
  which is essentially <span class="standout">Linux</span> running
  under Windows. With it I was able to run my web server (<a
  href="http://apache.org">Apache</a> running under <a
  href="http://cygwin.com">Cygwin</a>), mail server (<a
  href="http://exim.org">Exim</a>), <a
  href="http://www.proftpd.org">FTP</a> server, provide <a
  href="http://www.openssh.com">SSH</a> services as well as a very
  functional development environment using <a
  href="http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/bash.html">Bash</a>, <a
  href="http://perl.com">Perl</a>, <a
  href="http://xemacs.org">XEmacs</a>, <a
  href="http://www.vim.org">vi</a>, etc. That, plus running my XP
  Desktop, browsing the web (I use <a href="http://netscape.com">Netscape</a>
  and now <a
  href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox">Firefox</a> and <a
  href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/thunderbird">Thunderbird</a>),
  image processing, music production (<a
  href="http://www.steinberg.net/en/index.php">Cubase</a>, <a
  href="http://www.cakewalk.com/">Cakewalk</a>, Media players and the
  like), providing my answering machine in a 24/7 environment really
  has been taxing my poor old 450 Mhz machine!

  <p>Next I offloaded most services to my <a
  href="http://www.mandrakesoft.com/">Mandrake 9.1 Linux</a>
  system. Not that the <span class="standout">Linux</span> box is any
  more powered - it's a 333 Mhz machine but doesn't seem that bogged
  down since it's running <span class="standout">Linux</span>. More
  things will move to <span class="standout">Linux</span> because it
  just a lot easier to program and much more stable. Still the <span
  class="standout">Linux</span> box is quite responsive. I'm also
  starting to use <a href="http://mysql.com">MySQL</a> and am playing
  with some weblog software from <a
  href="http://movabletype.org">MovableType</a>.</p>

  <p>I've also set up <a
  href="http://gallery.sourceforge.net/">Gallery</a> which is a <a
  href="http://php.net">PHP</a> web application for managing a <a
  href="/gallery">photo gallery</a> and, of course, requires that your
  web server understands <a href="http://php.net">PHP</a>. I've been
  getting into <a href="http://php.net">PHP</a> lately and have been
  changing <a href="http://defaria.com/maps">MAPS</a> <a
  href="http://perl.com">Perl</a> based web pages with <a
  href="http://php.net">PHP</a> based web pages. For one, since the
  PHP intepreter is embedded in the <a
  href="http://httpd.apache.org">Apache web server</a> it's faster -
  I'd bet that mod_perl would make the <a
  href="http://perl.com">Perl</a> versions as quick but <a
  href="http://php.net">PHP</a> is more "web oriented" than <a
  href="http://perl.com">Perl</a> anyway.</p>

  <p>Finally I've installed <a
  href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ejw/authoring/">WebDAV</a> so I can
  host Mozilla's <i>Remote Calendars</i> from my web site. The goal is
  to centralize my data, my life, from my house, under my control and
  be able to provide me with all of my stuff from wherever I am. Also,
  I believe with <a
  href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ejw/authoring/">WebDAV</a> I will be
  able to use things like Netscape's <i>publish</i> option so that I
  can even edit my web pages from anywhere.<p>

  <h2><a name="Dell"></a>New Desktop - Dell Dimension 3000</h2>

  <p>After suffering for years with my 1998 450 Mhz PC I finally
  decided to get a new one. I was due! After getting some money from a
  side contract I purchased a Dell Dimension 3000. This sucker's a 3
  Ghz Hyperthreaded CPU with 512 Meg Memory. The video card is a
  little bit better (64 Meg of video memory whereas my old machine had
  only 8 Meg!).</p>

  <p>I got just a DVD player because I figured I could transfer my HP
  9100i CD Writer into this box. I also wanted to transfer the Sound
  Blaster Live Drive which is a CD spaced "drive" that connects to the
  sound card and allows you to plug in many things like michrophones,
  headphone, MIDI keyboards, Optical ins and outs, additional line ins
  and outs. This is convenient to be able to plug right into the front
  of the box. Alas, the Dell only has 2 bays so it was either the Live
  Drive or the CD Writer but not both! I choose the Live Drive at this
  time.</p>

  <p>I also got a voice grade modem hoping that I could finally get a true
  hands free speakerphone working but the damn modem that Dell uses isn't
  even TAPI compliant! I tried to move my USB voice modem from the old
  machine to the new one but was unable to plug it in. So I put this and
  the CD Writer back into the old machine.</p>

  <p>I also wanted to go to 24-bit 192 Khz sampling for a sound card.
  I decided to upgrade to a Sound Blaster Audigy 2 ZS. This card also
  features 5.1/6.1 and 7.1 outputs. I figured I could then play a
  little bit with making my own surround sound recordings. I also get
  a new surround sound set of speakers for this card. I hope to
  eventually meld my PC sound with my Bose Home Theater that I have. I
  now effectively have 2 home theater systems, one on my PC and one in
  my living room. Maybe one day the PC will move to the living room
  and start controlling my entertainment...</p>

  <p>All in all I'm quite happy with its performance. It is much
  faster than the old system and it supports standby. My old system
  supposedly also supported standby but that was on W98. Besides my
  old PC used to be my whole domain so it couldn't standby. Since
  services moved to Linux it could standby but on Windows 2000 and
  later XP it wouldn't standby! Videos play just great, no hesitation,
  no jerkyness and I can do other things while doing heavy
  processing. With the DVD drive came WinDVD so now DVDs work. My old
  system's DVD drive just plain broke.</p>

  <p>Maybe in the future I will move the Linux box up to the 450 Mhz
  (i.e. the old XP box) but right now it's still doing just find</p>

  <h2><a name="Compaq"></a>New server - Compaq Persario 3200+ Althon</h2>

  <p>Well my poor old server has really be stressing lately. With
  Gallery and Andromeda as well as handling email and filtering it
  though MAPS (using Perl and MySQL) the old gal was really starting
  to drag. But when I went from Andromeda to Jinzora - a much more
  feature rich web application for maintaining your media collection
  and streaming it on the net - it was quickly becoming
  unstable. Often I had to just reboot her because she was swaping so
  much that she would eventually crash or just go off the net because
  she was just way to busy - sorta like falling asleep on the job.</p>

  <p>It's a good thing that system prices have come way down -
  especially if all you are really looking for is raw speed and don't
  need to buy all of the added junk like sound cards, Windows XP,
  gaming capable video adapters and the like. Hell I don't care about
  that! I'm just gonna be installing Linux on it anyway. Don't need no
  fancy monitors or speaker systems on this machine - hell I don't
  even have a monitor on my servers! I just stick them in a closet and
  access them remotely!</p>

  <p>For example, this system is 2.2Ghz (Athlon 3200+), has 512 Meg of
  memory, a 160 Gig drive. Oh it also has a DVD/CD writer combo and
  even an extra CDROM drive as well as things like connections for
  headphones and USB ports on the front. I won't be using any of those
  but hey they came with the box. I may use the DVD Writer though... I
  believe it had XP Home on it but honestly I never booted it up with
  XP. Just stuck in the Linux boot CD and went from there. Totally
  price? $399!</p>

  <p>It was an opportunity for me, however, to go from Mandrake 9.1 to
  a more modern and common Linux Distro - Fedora Core 3 (Yeah I know
  Core 4 is out). This did, however, entail some confiuguration
  changes. I had to remember all the config changes I did to the old
  box and replicate them here. Then I had to move data from the old
  system to the new, move MySQL DBs, reconfigure applications, install
  Perl modules, set up various system level services and the like.</p>

  <p>I also took this opportunity to update some of my web
  apps. Gallery's now at 2.0 and Jinzora is now 2.2. Moveable Type
  went up to 3.2. Nicer apps now, more speed, etc. What can I say?</p>

  <h2><a name="projects"></a>Current Projects</h2>

  <h3><a href="http://quikiwiki.com">QuikiWiki</a></h3>

  <p>I wanted to get into and understand Wiki's, which are
  collaborative web sites or CMS (Content Management Systems), and
  decided to set up a wiki for Quicken. Plus the name <a
  href="http://quikiwiki.com">QuikiWiki.com</a> was just too cute to
  pass up! Plus my <a href="/Quicken">Unofficial Quicken Web Page</a>
  (noticably absent from the menu on the left) was too stale to be of
  much use anymore. I don't want this to be too much of time drain on
  me. Wiki's have the potential of solving that problem because every
  account member has authorship rights for creating and maintaining
  the pages. The wiki engine I choose was <a
  href="http://tikiwiki.org">TikiWiki</a> and it has a ton of features
  like <a href="http://quikiwiki.com/tiki-forums.php">forums</a>, <a
  href="http://quikiwiki.com/tiki-list_faqs.php">FAQs</a> and much,
  much more. Check it out!</p>

  help us to build the best wiki for Quicken!</p>

  <h3>MAPS</h3>

  <p>One of my big projects right now is <a href="/maps">MAPS</a>
  a <i>Mail Authorization and Permission System</i>. In concept it's
  pretty simple - all email is considered potentially spam until and
  unless the sender registers for the privilege of emailing the MAPS
  user. This dramatically cuts down on spam.</p>

  <p>I am currently working on porting <a href="/maps">MAPS</a> over
  to use <a href="http://mysql.com">MySQL</a> database back end and to
  spruce up the front end so this area is definitely in flux right
  now.</p>

  <p>MAPS is now running on my <span class="standout">Linux</span> box
  using <a href="http://mysql.com">MySQL</a>. It is pretty functional
  but not yet ready for prime time.

  <h3>Music</h3>

  <p>While not a technology project as per se, the old <a 
  href="/Band"><i>Cast of Shadows</i></a> band is working on new 
  material. It's interesting because we've all gotten more into 
  computers so now we are writing new material and passing it around 
  our computers using software as our studio.</p>

  <p>I started putting together some <a href="http://php.net">PHP</a>
  code to browse my music collection. While this was an interesting
  exercise, when looking for some <a href="http://php.net">PHP</a>
  code to get ID3 tags out of Windows Media Audio files (.wma as I use
  them more than .mp3 format because they are usually much smaller in
  size) I came across <a
  href="http://www.turnstyle.com/andromeda">Andromeda</a> which does a
  much nicer job than I could do unless I spent a lot of my time doing
  it. <a href="http://defaria.com/Music">My Music Collection</a> is
  now online!</p>

  <h3>Photo Gallery</h3>

  <p>I've also put a bunch of my photos into a photo <a 
  href="/gallery">gallery</a>. <a 
  href="http://gallery.sourceforge.net/">Gallery</a> is open source 
  software that runs on my web server and uses PHP. As it seems to 
  do a fine job on it's own I'll just use it. Maybe I'll tweak it 
  some later...</p>

  <h3>Weblogging</h3>

  <p>I've also installed weblogging software from <a
  href="http://www.movabletype.org/">Movable Type</a>. This package is
  written in <a href="http://perl.com">Perl</a> and also runs on my
  Linux web server. Blogging is not only a culture but can be
  tremendous time sync. As such I have not sunk that much time into it
  but I have sunk some time into it. There are lots of "plugins" and
  tweaks for Movable Type and being written in <a
  href="http://perl.com">Perl</a> the community seems to be encouraged
  to hack it. Maybe sometime when I get more time. Meantime I've
  basically used it for a part of Danielle's section of the web site
  and I also use it to keep track of my work status.</p>

  <h3>Cascading Style Sheets</h3>

  <p>Partly due to Movable Type and my MAPS project I started getting
  into Cascading Style Sheets. They're pretty cool and I'm not an
  expert but I can get around in them a little bit now.</p>
