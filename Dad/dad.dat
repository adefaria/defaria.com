I met Charlie and his family while living downstairs from them in Newark, We all got to be good friends. Though I haven't seen Charlie in years I have been in touch with his sister Mary for all these years and to this day. I have always asked about him. He was a Great Guy and I know he loved his children and would liked to have visited more, but was too far away. I am glad that they got closer as the years went by, that made him very happy. Charlie and his mother Rose were Godparents to my first son. <br>My 3 Sons Chuck, Gary, Tom and I send our prayers and thoughts to you all in this time of sorrow. <br>Charlie will be missed by all.|~|http://|~|206.148.124.93|~|
