  What can I say, like most fathers I'm extremely proud of my
  daughter. She's a treasure to me and many other people say that she
  is adorable. Who am I to argue?</p>

  <p>She was born on <a href="BirthAnnouncement.php">April 15,
  1992</a> (my little tax exemption!) after a mere 3 and 1/2 hours of
  labor at exactly 12:36 AM. Her middle name is derived from Rose
  Faria, her great grandmother (my grandmother) and Mary, her other
  great grandmother (Mary Shaw from her mother's side).</p>

  <p>One of her hobbies is going to baseball games (she likes the
  Giants, naturally) and, like many other kids her age, she likes to
  eat ice cream. Above is a unique photo that captures her doing what
  she likes best.</p>
