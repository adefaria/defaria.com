  <p>An older couple is at a airplane fair. The old husband just loves
  planes and is dying to take a spin in one. However his wife is cheap
  and has set their spending limit to $50.00. They already spent that
  amount during the course of the day. The husband notices a sign that
  says "Escorted Flights for $50.00" Seeing this the old man is
  overjoyed (Damn that's cheap).</p>

  <p>He goes to his wife: "Honey, lets do this flight thing"</p>

  <p>Wife: "No, $50.00 is $50.00"</p>

  <p>The pilot notices the look of disappointment on the old man face
  and approaches the couple...</p>

  <p>"I'll let the both of you fly for free. The only condition is
  that you can't talk or make any noise while we are in the air. If
  you do than I'll charge you the $50.00"</p>

  <p>The old man's wife thinks a bit "All right, that will save us
  $50.00. $50.00 is $50.00"</p>

  <p>The pilot and the couple goes up in the air. The old man is
  having a grand time. The pilot even wows him more by doing some
  turns and aviation acrobats.</p>

  <p>When they land the pilot notices that the wife is not in the
  plane. "Hey, what happened to your wife?"</p>

  <p>The old man replies, "She fell out of the plane"</p>

  <p>Shocked at his point blank response "Well, why didn't you say
  anything?"</p>

  <p>The old man... "$50.00 IS $50.00"</p>
