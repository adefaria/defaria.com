  <p>Little Tommy's parents had tried everything to help his math grade:
  tutors, flash cards, "Hooked on Math," special learning centers,
  everything. Finally, they enrolled him in the local Catholic school.</p>

  <p>The very first day, he came home with a very serious look on his face,
  went straight to his room, and started studying. His mother was
  amazed. Books and paper were spread out everywhere and Little Tommy
  was hard at work. As soon as dinner was through, he marched right back
  up to his room without a word and studied some more. This went on for
  weeks until Little Tommy proudly brought home his report card and
  showed it to his parents.</p>

  <p>An A in Math! "Tommy! This is great! I'm so proud of you! Son, what
  was it? What helped motivate you? Was it the nuns?" Little Tommy shook
  his head.</p>

  <p>"Well, then, was it the books? The discipline? The structure? The
  uniforms? What?" Little Tommy looked at her and said, "Well, Mom, it's
  like this.</p>

  <p>When I saw that guy out in the lobby nailed to a plus sign, I knew
  they weren't screwing around!"</p>
