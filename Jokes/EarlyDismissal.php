  <p>It is near the Christmas break of the school year. The students
  have turned in all their work and there is really nothing more to
  do. All the children are restless and the teacher decides to have an
  early dismissal.</p>

  <p><b>Teacher:</b> Whoever answers the questions I ask, first and
  correctly can leave early today.</p>

  <p><b>Little Johnny says to himself</b> Good, I want to get outta
  here. I'm smart and will answer the question.</p>

  <p><b>Teacher:</b> Who said "Four Score and Seven Years Ago?"</p>

  <p>Before Johnny can open his mouth, Susie says, "Abraham
  Lincoln".</p>

  <p><b>Teacher:</b> That's right Susie, you can go home.</p>

  <p>Johnny is mad that Susie answered the question first.</p>

  <p><b>Teacher:</b> Who said "I Have a Dream"?</p>

  <p>Before Johnny can open his mouth, Mary says, "Martin Luther
  King".</p>

  <p><b>Teacher:</b> That's right Mary, you can go.</p>

  <p>Johnny is even madder than before.</p>

  <p><b>Teacher:</b> Who said "Ask not, what your country can do for
  you?"</p>

  <p>Before Johnny can open his mouth, Nancy says, "John
  F. Kennedy".</b>

  <p><b>Teacher:</b> That's right Nancy, you may also leave.</p>

  <p>Johnny is boiling mad that he has not been able to answer to any
  of the questions.</p>


  <p>When the teacher turns her back Johnny says, "I wish these
  bitches would keep their mouths shut!"</p>


  <p>The teacher turns around: <b>"Now who said that"?</b></p>

  <p><b>Johnny:</b> Tiger Woods. Can I go now?!?</p>
