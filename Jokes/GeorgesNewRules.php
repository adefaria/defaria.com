  <p>I thought only Bill Maher was doing <i>New Rules</i> but
  apparently George Carlin is too:</p>

  <ul>

    <li>Stop giving me that pop-up ad for Classmates.com!  There's a
    reason you don't talk to people for 25 years. Because you don't
    particularly like them! Besides, I already know what the captain
    of the football team is doing these days: - mowing my lawn.</li>
 
    <li>Don't eat anything that's served to you out a window unless
    you're a seagull. People are acting all shocked that a human
    finger was found in a bowl of Wendy's chili. Hey, it cost less
    than a dollar. What did you expect it to contain? Trout?</li>
 
    <li>Stop saying that teenage boys who have sex with their hot,
    blonde teachers are permanently damaged. I have a better
    description for these kids: - lucky bastards.</li>
 
    <li>If you need to shave and you still collect baseball cards,
    you're gay. If you're a kid, the cards are keepsakes of your
    idols. If you're a grown man, they're pictures of men.</li>
 
    <li>Ladies, leave your eyebrows alone. Here's how much men care
    about your eyebrows: - do you have two of them? Okay, we're
    done.</li>
 
    <li>There's no such thing as flavored water. There's a whole aisle
    of this crap at the supermarket? Water, but without that watery
    taste.  Sorry, but flavored water is called a soft drink. You want
    flavored water?  Pour some scotch over ice and let it melt. That's
    your flavored water.</li>
 
    <li>The more complicated the Starbucks order, the bigger the
    asshole. If you walk into a Starbucks and order a "decaf Grande
    half-soy, half-low fat, iced vanilla, double-shot, gingerbread
    cappuccino, extra dry, light ice, with one Sweet-n'-Low and one
    NutraSweet," ooh, you're a huge asshole.</li>
 
    <li>I'm not the cashier! By the time I look up from sliding my
    card, entering my PIN number, pressing "Enter," verifying the
    amount, deciding, no, I don't want cash back, and pressing "Enter"
    again, the kid who is supposed to be ringing me up is standing
    there eating my Almond Joy.</li>

    <li>Just because your tattoo has Chinese characters in it doesn't
    make you spiritual. It's right above the crack of your ass. And it
    translates to "beef with broccoli." The last time you did anything
    spiritual, you were praying to God you weren't pregnant. You're
    not spiritual. You're just high.</li>
 
    <li>I don't need a bigger mega M&M. If I'm extra hungry for M&Ms,
    I'll go nuts and eat two.</li>
 
    <li>If you're going to insist on making movies based on crappy,
    old television shows, then you have to give everyone in the
    Cineplex a remote so we can see what's playing on the other
    screens. Let's remember the reason something was a television show
    in the first place is that the idea wasn't good enough to be a
    movie.</li>

    <li>No more gift registries. You know, it used to be just for
    weddings. Now it's for babies and new homes and graduations from
    rehab.  Picking out the stuff you want and having other people buy
    it for you isn't gift giving, it's the white people's version of
    looting.</li>
 
    <li>And this one is long overdue: - No more bathroom attendants.
    After I zip up, some guy is offering me a towel and a mint like I
    just had sex with George Michael. I can't even tell if he's
    supposed to be there, or just some freak with a fetish. I don't
    want to be on your web cam, dude. I just want to wash my
    hands.</li>
 
    <li>When I ask how old your toddler is, I don't need to know in
    months. "27 Months." "He's two," will do just fine. He's not a
    cheese. And I didn't really care in the first place.</li>
  </ul>
