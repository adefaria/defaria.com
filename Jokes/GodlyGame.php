  <p>Moses pulled up to the tee and drove a long one. The ball landed
  in the fairway, but kept rolling directly toward a water
  hazard. Moses quickly raised his club, the water parted and the ball
  rolled to the other side, safe and sound.</p>

  <p>Next, Jesus strolled up to the tee and hit a nice long drive
  directly toward the same water hazard. It landed right in the center
  of the pond and kind of hovered over the water. Jesus casually
  walked out on the pond and chipped the ball back onto the green.</p>

  <p>The third guy got up and sort of randomly whacked the ball. It
  headed out over the fence and into oncoming traffic on a nearby
  street. It bounced off a truck and veered toward a nearby tree. From
  there, the ball bounced onto the roof of a shack close by and rolled
  down into the gutter, down the drainspout, out onto the fairway and
  straight toward the aforementioned pond. On the way to the pond, the
  ball hit a little stone and bounced out over the water onto a lily
  pad, where it rested quietly.</p>

  <p>Suddenly a very large bullfrog jumped up on the lily pad and
  snatched the ball into his mouth. Just then, an eagle swooped down
  and grabbed the frog and flew away. As they passed over the green,
  the frog screamed with fright and dropped the ball, which bounced
  right into the cup for a hole in one.</p>

  <p>Moses turned to Jesus and said, "I hate playing with your
  Dad."</p>
