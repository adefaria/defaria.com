  <p>The beautiful secretary of the president of a bank goes on a sight-seeing
  tour with a very rich African king who was a very important client. The 
  client out of the blue asks her to marry him. Naturally, the secretary is
  quite taken aback. However, she remembers what her boss told her, ...don't
  reject the guy outright.</p>
  
  <p>So, she tries to think of a way to dissuade the businessman from wanting 
  to marry her. After a few minutes, the woman says to the man, "I will only 
  marry you under three conditions. First, I want my engagement ring to be a 
  75-carat diamond ring with a matching 200-carat diamond tiara."</p>
 
  <p>The African king pauses for awhile. Then, he nods his head and says, "No 
  problem!! I have. I have."</p>
 
  <p>Realizing her first condition was too easy the woman says to the man, 
  "I want you to build me a 100-room mansion in New York. As a vacation home, 
  I want a chateau built in the middle of the best wine country in France."</p>
  
  <p>The African king pauses for awhile. He whips out his cellular phone and
  calls some brokers in New York and in France. He looks at the woman, nods
  his head and says, "Okay, okay. I build. I build."</p>
 
  <p>Realizing that she only has one last condition, the secretary knows that
  she'd better make this a good one. She takes her time to think and finally
  she gets an idea. A sure-to-work condition. She squints her eyes, looks at
  the man and says, rather coldly, "Since I like sex, I want the man I marry
  to have a 14-inch penis."</p>
  
  <p>The man seems a bit disturbed. He cups his face with his hands and rests
  his elbows on the table, all the while muttering in African dialect. Finally,
  after what seemed like forever, the king shakes his head, looking really sad,
  and says to the woman, "Okay, okay. I cut. I cut."</p>
