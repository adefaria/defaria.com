  <p>An Indian named Tom walks into a cafe with a shotgun in one hand
  pulling a male buffalo with the other. He says to the waiter, "Me
  want coffee. "Sure chief, coming right up." He gets the Indian a
  tall mug of coffee. The Indian drinks the coffee down in one gulp,
  turns and blasts the buffalo with the shotgun, causing parts of
  animal to splatter every where, then just walks out.</p>

  <p>The next morning the Indian returns. He has his shotgun in one
  hand pulling another male buffalo with the other. He walks up to the
  counter and says to the waiter, "Me want coffee." The waiter says,
  "Whoa, Tonto! We're still cleaning up your mess from yesterday. What
  was all that about, anyway?"</p>

  <p>The Indian smiles and proudly says, "Me training for upper
  management position: Come in, drink coffee, shoot the bull, leave
  mess for others to clean up, disappear for rest of day."</p>
