  <p>A man was wandering in the woods pondering all the questions of
  life, the universe, and his own personal problems. The man could
  not find any answers so he sought help from God.</p>

  <p>"God!? God?! Are you there God?!", he shouted.</p>

  <p>God responded, "What is it my son?"</p>

  <p>"I have a few questions, mind if I ask?"</p>

  <p>"Go right ahead, my son - ask anything," God said.</p>

  <p>"God, what is a million years to you?"</p>

  <p>God said, "a million years to me is only a second."</p>

  <p>"Hmmm", he wondered. Then he asked again, "God, what is a million
  dollars worth to you?"</p>
  
  <p>God said, "A million dollars to me is only worth a penny."</p>

  <p>The man lifted his eyebrows and proceeded to ask a final
  question. "God can I have a penny?"</p>

  <p>And God cheerfully said, "Sure!!.....in a second."</p>
