  <p>An engineer went to hell when he died, saw that he could make a
  lot of improvements to the infrastructure, and with Satan's
  blessings had elevators, running water, and air conditioning
  installed in no time. God saw what was going on and told Satan that
  he wanted the engineer sent to heaven because sending him to hell
  was an obvious mistake. When Satan refused to let the engineer go,
  God threatened to sue him. "Where are you going to get a lawyer?"
  Satan asked.</p>
