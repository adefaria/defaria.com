  <p>The Mother Superior in the convent school was chatting with her
  young charges and she asked them what they wanted to be when they
  grew up.</p>

  <p>A twelve year-old said, "I want to be a prostitute."</p>

  <p>The Mother Superior fainted dead away on the spot.  When they
  revived her, she raised her head from the ground and gasped, "What
  did you say?"</p>

  <p>The young girl shrugged.  "I said I want to be a prostitute."</p>

  <p>"A prostitute!" the Mother Superior said.  "Oh, praise Sweet
  Jesus!  I thought you said you wanted to be a Protestant."</p>
