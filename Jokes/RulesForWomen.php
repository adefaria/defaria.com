  <ul>
    <li>Learn to work the toilet seat. You're a big girl. If it's up,
    put it down. We need it up, you need it down. You don't hear us
    complaining about you leaving it down.</li>

    <li>Birthdays, Valentines, and Anniversaries are not quests to see
    if we can find the perfect present yet again!</li>

    <li>Sometimes we are not thinking about you. Live with it.</li>

    <li>Sunday equals sports. It's like the full moon or the changing
    of the tides. Let it be.</li>

    <li>Don't cut your hair. Ever. Long hair is always more attractive
    than short hair. One of the big reasons guys fear getting married
    is that married women always cut their hair, and by then you're
    stuck with her.</li>

    <li>Shopping is NOT a sport. And no, we are never going to think
    of it that way.</li>

    <li>Crying is blackmail.</li>

    <li>Ask for what you want. Let us be clear on this one: Subtle
    hints do not work! Strong hints do not work! Obvious hints do not
    work! Just say it!</li>

    <li>We don't remember dates. Mark birthdays and anniversaries on a
    calendar. Remind us frequently beforehand.</li>

    <li>Most guys own three pairs of shoes , tops. What makes you
    think we'd be any good at choosing which pair, out of thirty,
    would look good with your dress?</li>

    <li>Yes and No are perfectly acceptable answers to almost every
    question.</li>

    <li>Come to us with a problem only if you want help solving
    it. That's what we do. Sympathy is what your girlfriends are
    for.</li>

    <li>A headache that lasts for 17 months is a problem. See a
    doctor.</li>

    <li>Check your oil! Please.</li>

    <li>Anything we said 6 months ago is inadmissible in an
    argument. In fact, all comments become null and void after 7
    days.</li>

    <li>If you won't dress like the Victoria's Secret girls, don't
    expect us to act like soap opera guys.</li>

    <li>If something we said can be interpreted two ways, and one of
    the ways makes you sad or angry, we meant the other one.</li>

    <li>Let us ogle. We are going to look anyway, it's genetic.</li>

    <li>You can either ask us to do something or tell us how you want
    it done. Not both. If you already know best how to do it, just do
    it yourself.</li>

    <li>Whenever possible, please say whatever you have to say during
    commercials.</li>

    <li>Christopher Columbus did not need directions, and neither do
    we.</li>

    <li>The relationship is never going to be like it was the first
    two months we were going out. Get over it. And quit whining to
    your girlfriends.</li>

    <li>ALL men see in only 16 colors, like Windows default
    settings. Peach, for example, is a fruit, not a color. Pumpkin is
    also a fruit. We have no idea what mauve is.</li>

    <li>If it itches, it will be scratched. We do that.</li>

    <li>We are not mind readers and we never will be. Our lack of
    mind-reading ability is not proof of how little we care about
    you.</li>

    <li>If we ask what is wrong and you say "nothing," we will act
    like nothing's wrong. We know you are lying, but it is just not
    worth the hassle.</li>

    <li>If you ask a question you don't want an answer to, expect an
    answer you don't want to hear.</li>

    <li>When we have to go somewhere, absolutely anything you wear is
    fine. Really !!!</li>

    <li>Don't ask us what we're thinking about unless you are prepared
    to discuss such topics as navel lint, the shotgun formation, or
    monster trucks.</li>

    <li>You have enough clothes.</li>

    <li>You have too many shoes.</li>

    <li>Foreign films are best left to foreigners. (Unless it's Bruce
    Lee or some war flick where it doesn't really matter what they're
    saying anyway.)</li>

    <li>It is neither in your best interest or ours to take the quiz
    together. No, it doesn't matter which quiz.</li>

    <li>BEER is as exciting for us as handbags are for you.</li>

    <li>I'm in shape. ROUND is a shape.</li>

    <li>Thank you for reading this, Yes, I know, I have to sleep on
    the couch tonight, but did you know we really don't mind that,
    it's like camping.</li>
