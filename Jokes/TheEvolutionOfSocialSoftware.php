<h2>Wife 1.0 Just Released</h2>

<hr style="noshade">
<p>Dear Tech Support,</p>

<p>A long time ago I upgraded from <span class="standout">Girlfriend
7.0</span> to <span class="standout">Wife 1.0</span> and noticed that
the new program began unexpected child processing that took up a lot
of new space and valuable resources. No mention of this phenomenon was
included in the product brochure.</p>

<p>In addition, <span class="standout">Wife 1.0</span> installs itself
into all other programs and launches during system initialization,
where it monitors all other system activity. Applications such as
<span class="standout">Poker Night 10.3</span>, <span
class="standout">Drunken Boys Night 2.5</span> and <span
class="standout">Saturday Football 5.0</span> no longer run, crashing
the system whenever selected.</p>

<p>I cannot seem to keep <span class="standout">Wife 1.0</span> in the
background while attempting to run some of my other favorite
applications. I am thinking about going back to <span
class="standout">Girlfriend 7.0</span>, but the uninstall does not
work on this program.</p>

<p>Can you please
help me !!!???</p>

<p>Thanks,<br>

A TROUBLED USER</p>

<hr style="noshade"> 

<p>Dear TROUBLED USER,</p>

<p>This is a very common problem, but is mostly due to a primary
misconception. Many people upgrade from <span
class="standout">Girlfriend 7.0</span> to <span class="standout">Wife
1.0</span> with the idea that <span class="standout">Wife 1.0</span>
is merely a <b>Utilities &amp; Entertainment</b> program. <span
class="standout">Wife 1.0</span> is an <b>Operating System</b> and
designed by its creator to run everything.</p>

<p>It is unlikely you would be able to purge <span
class="standout">Wife 1.0</span> and still convert back to <span
class="standout">Girlfriend 7.0</span>.  Hidden operating files within
your system would cause <span class="standout">Girlfriend 7.0</span>
to emulate <span class="standout">Wife 1.0</span> so nothing is
gained. It is impossible to uninstall, delete, or purge the program
files from the system once installed. You cannot go back to <span
class="standout">Girlfriend 7.0</span> because <span
class="standout">Wife 1.0</span> is not designed to do
this.</p>

<p>Some have tried to install <span class="standout">Girlfriend
8.0</span> or <span class="standout">Wife 2.0</span> but end up with
more problems than the original system.  Look in your manual under
"Warnings- Alimony/Child support". We recommend you keep <span
class="standout">Wife 1.0</span>.

<p>We suggest installing background application program <tt>C:\YES
DEAR</tt> to alleviate software augmentation. We also suggest you read
the entire section regarding General Partnership Faults (GPFs). You
must assume all responsibility for faults and problems that might
occur, regardless of their cause. The best course of action will be to
enter the command <tt>C:\APOLOGIZE</tt>. In any case avoid excessive
use of <tt>C:\YES DEAR</tt> because ultimately you may have to give
the <tt>APOLOGIZE </tt>command before the operating system will return
to normal. The system will run smoothly as long as you take the blame
for all the GPFs.</p>

<p><span class="standout">Wife 1.0</span> is a program, but very
high-maintenance. Consider buying additional software to improve the
performance of <span class="standout">Wife 1.0</span>. We recommend
<span class="standout">Flowers 3.1</span> and <span
class="standout">Diamonds 2K</span>. Do not, under any circumstances
install <span class="standout">Secretary with Short Skirt 3.3</span>.
This is not a supported application for <span class="standout">Wife
1.0</span> and is likely to cause irreversible damage to the operating
system.</p>

<hr style="noshade">

<p>Last year a friend of mine upgraded <span
class="standout">GirlFriend 1.0</span> to <span class="standout">Wife
1.0</span> and found that it's a memory hog leaving very little system
resources for other applications. He is only now noticing that <span
class="standout">Wife 1.0</span> also is spawning child processes
which are further consuming valuable resources.</p>

<p>No mention of this particular phenomena was included in the product
brochure or the documentation, though other users have informed him
that this is to be expected due to the nature of the application. Not
only that, <span class="standout">Wife 1.0</span> installs itself such
that it is always launched at system initialisation where it can
monitor all other system activity. He's finding that some applications
such as <span class="standout">PokerNight 10.3</span>, <span
class="standout">BeerBash 2.5</span>, and <span
class="standout">PubNight 7.0</span> are no longer able to run in the
system at all, crashing the system when selected even though they
always worked fine before.</p>

<p>At installation, <span class="standout">Wife 1.0</span> provides no
option as to the installation of undesired Plug-Ins such as <span
class="standout">MotherInLaw 55.8</span> and <span
class="standout">BrotherInLaw Beta Release</span>. Also, system
performance seems to diminish with each passing day. Some features
he'd like to see in the upcoming <span class="standout">Wife
2.0</span>.

<ul>

<li>A "Don't remind me again" button</li>

<li>Minimize button</li>

<li>An install shield feature that allows <span class="standout">Wife
2.0</span> be installed with the option to uninstall at anytime
without the loss of cache and other system resources.</li>

<li>An option to run the network driver in promiscuous
mode which would allow the systems hardware probe feature to be much
more useful.</li>

</ul>

<p>I myself decided to avoid all of the headaches associated with
<span class="standout">Wife 1.0</span> by sticking with <span
class="standout">GirlFriend 2.0</span>.  Even here, however, I found
many problems. Apparently you cannot install <span
class="standout">GirlFriend 2.0</span> on top of <span
class="standout">GirlFriend 1.0</span>. You must uninstall <span
class="standout">GirlFriend 1.0</span> first. Other users say this is
a long standing bug which I should have been aware of.  Apparently the
versions of <span class="standout">GirlFriend</span> have conflicts
over shared use of the I/O port. You think they would have fixed such
a stupid bug by now.  To make matters worse, the uninstall program for
<span class="standout">GirlFriend 1.0</span> doesn't work very well
leaving undesirable traces of the application in the system. Another
thing that sucks - all versions of <span
class="standout">GirlFriend</span> continually pop-up little annoying
messages about the advantages of upgrading to <span
class="standout">Wife 1.0</span>.</p>

<h2>BUG WARNING</h2>

<p><span class="standout">Wife 1.0</span> has an undocumented bug.  If
you try to install <span class="standout">Mistress 1.1</span> before
uninstalling <span class="standout">Wife 1.0</span>, <span
class="standout">Wife 1.0</span> will delete MSMoney files before
doing the uninstall itself. Then <span
class="standout">Mistress 1.1</span> will refuse to install,
claiming insufficient resources.</p

<h2>WORK-AROUNDS</h2>

<p>To avoid the above bug, try installing <span
class="standout">Mistress 1.1</span> on a different system and never
run any file transfer applications such as <span
class="standout">Laplink 6.0</span>. Also, beware of similar shareware
applications that have been known to carry viruses that may affect
<span class="standout">Wife 1.0</span>. Another solution would be to
run <span class="standout">Mistress 1.1</span> via a Usenet provider
under an anonymous name. Here again, beware of the viruses which can
accidently be downloaded from the Usenet.</p>

<hr style="noshade">

<p>Seems like the only solution to <span class="standout">Wife
1.0</span> is to install <span class="standout">Divorce
1.0</span>. This is a radical package however it will erradicate Wife
1.0... at least partcially. And you usually get most of your resources
back (or at least.</p>

<p><span class="standout">Divorce 1.0</span>'s installation process
will remove <span class="standout">Wife 1.0</span>, preparing you to
install any of <span class="standout">GirlFriend 2.0</span>, <span
class="standout">Mistress 1.2</span> (new version!) or <span
class="standout">Wife 2.0</span> (if you want). Unfortunately if <span
class="standout">Wife 1.0</span> (or any of the other products
mentioned) have spawned child processes then things get more
complex. Usually the child processes take up less processing power and
they surface from time to time, but you're often glad to see
them. Unfortunately the child processes tend to remind you of the
package from whence they came and sometimes you have to interact with
<span class="standout">Wife 1.0</span> or <span
class="standout">GirlFriend 1.0</span>, but usually these things can
be dismissed fairly easily.</p>

<p>As <span class="standout">Divorce 1.0</span> needs to uninstall
<span class="standout">Wife 1.0</span> it carries all the caveats that
uninstalling <span class="standout">Wife 1.0</span> has. Usually you
are left with about 1/2 of the resources you started with before
installing <span class="standout">Wife 1.0</span>.</p>

<p>If you have already upgraded to <span
class="standout">Wife 2.0</span> then you'll need to get <span
class="standout">Divorce 2.0</span>.</p>
