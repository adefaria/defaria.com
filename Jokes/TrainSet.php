  <p>A mother was working in the kitchen listening to her 5 year old son
  playing with his new electric train in the living room. </p>

  <p>She heard the train stop and her son saying, "All of you sons of bitches
  who want off, get the hell off now... cause this is the last stop! And all 
  of you sons of bitches who are getting on, get your asses in the train cause 
  we're going down the tracks".</p>

  <p>The horrified mother went in and told her son, "We don't use that kind of
  language in this house. Now, I want you to go to your room and you are to 
  stay there for <b>two hours</b>. When you come out, you may play with your
  train... but I want you to use nice language." </p>

  <p>Two hours later, the son came out of the bedroom and resumed playing with
  his train. Soon the train stopped and the mother heard her son say... "All
  passengers, please remember to take all of your belongings with you. We
  thank you and hope your trip was a pleasant one. We hope you will ride with
  us again soon."</p>

  <p>She heard her little darling continue... "for those of you just boarding,
  remember there is no smoking in the train. We hope you will have a pleasant
  and relaxing journey with us today."</p>

  <p>As the mother began to smile, the child added, "For those of you who are
  pissed off about the <b>two hour</b> delay, please see the bitch in the
  kitchen..."</p>
