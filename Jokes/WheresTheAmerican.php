  <p>A Somali arrives in Minneapolis as a new immigrant to the United
  States. He stops the first person he sees walking down the street
  and says, "Thank you Mr. American for letting me in this country!"
  But the passerby says "You are mistaken, I am Mexican".</p>

  <p>The man goes on and encounters another passerby "Thank you for
  having such a beautiful country here in America!" The person says "I
  no American, I Vietnamese."

  <p>The new arrival walks further, and the next person he sees he
  stops, shakes his hand and says "Thank you for the wonderful
  America!" That person puts up his hand and says "I am from Middle
  East, I am not an American!"</p>

  <p>He finally sees a nice lady and asks suspiciously, "Are you an
  American?" She says, "No, I am from Russia!" So he is puzzled, and
  asks her, "Where are all the Americans?" The Russian lady looks at
  her watch, shrugs, and says... "Probably at work."</p>
