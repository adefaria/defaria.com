  <h2>Monday</h2>

  <h3>8:05 AM</h3>

  <p>User called to say they forgot password. Told them to use
  password retrieval utility called FDISK. Blissfully ignorant, they
  thank me and hang up. And we let these people vote and drive, too?</p>

  <h3>8:12 AM</h3>

  <p>Accounting called to say they couldn't access expense reports
  database.  Gave them Standard Sys Admin Answer #112, "Well, it works
  for me." Let them rant and rave while I unplugged my coffee maker
  from the UPS and plugged their server back in. Suggested they try it
  again. One more happy customer...</p>

  <h3>8:14 AM</h3>

  <p>User from 8:05 called and said they received error message "Error
  accessing Drive 0." Told them it was an OS problem. Transferred them
  to micro support.</p>
  
  <h3>11:00 a.m</h3>
 
  <p>Relatively quiet for last few hours. Decide to plug support phone 
  back in so I can call my girlfriend. Says parents are coming into town 
  this weekend. Put her on hold and transferred her to janitorial closet 
  down in basement. What is she thinking? The Myst and Doom nationals are 
  this weekend!</p>

  <h3>11:34 AM</h3>

  <p>Another user calls (do they ever learn?). Says they want ACL
  changed on HR performance review database so that nobody but HR can
  access database. Tell them no problem. Hang up. Change ACL. Add
  @MailSend so performance reviews are sent to */US.</p>

  <h3>12:00 PM</h3>

  <p>Lunch</p>

  <h3>3:30 PM</h3>

  <p>Return from lunch.</p>

  <h3>3:55 PM</h3>

  <p>Wake up from nap. Bad dream. Makes me cranky. Bounce servers for
  no reason. Return to napping.</p>

  <h3>4:23 PM</h3>

  <p>Yet another user calls. Wants to know how to change fonts on
  a form. Ask them what chip set they're using. Tell them to call back
  when they find out.</p>

  <h3>4:55 PM</h3>

  <p>Decide to run "Create Save/Replication Conflicts" macro so next
  shift has something to do.

  <h2>Tuesday</h2>

  <h3>8:30 PM</h3>

  <p>Finish reading support log from last night. Sounded
  busy. Terrible time with Save/Replication conflicts.</p>

  <h3>9:00 AM</h3>

  <p>Support manager arrives. Wants to discuss my attitude. Click on
  Phone Notes SmartIcon. "Love to, but kinda busy. Put something in
  the calendar database!" I yell as I grab for the support lines,
  which have (mysteriously) lit up.  Walks away grumbling.</p>

  <h3>9:35 PM</h3>

  <p>Team leader from R&amp;D needs ID for new employee. Tell them
  they need form J-19R=9C9\\DARR\K1. Say they never heard of such a
  form. Tell them it's in the SPECIAL FORMS database. Say they never
  heard of such a database.  Transfer them to janitorial closet in
  basement.</p>

  <h3>10:00 AM</h3>

  <p>Perky sounding intern from R&amp;D calls and says she needs new
  ID. Tell her I need employee number, department name, manager name,
  and marital status. Run @DbLookup against state parole board
  database, Centers for Disease Control database, and my Oprah Winfrey
  database. No hits. Tell her ID will be ready tonight. Drawing from
  the lessons learned in last week's "Reengineering for Customer
  Partnership," I offer to personally deliver ID to her apartment.</p>

  <h3>10:07 AM</h3>

  <p>Janitor stops by to say he keeps getting strange calls in
  basement. Offer to train him on Notes. Begin now. Let him watch
  console while I grab a smoke.</p>

  <h3>1:00 PM</h3>

  <p>Return from smoking break. Janitor says phones kept ringing, so
  he transferred them to cafeteria lady. I like this guy.</p>

  <h3>1:05 PM</h3>

  <p>Big commotion! Support manager falls in hole left where I pulled
  floor tiles outside his office door. Stress to him importance of not
  running in computer room, even if I do yell "FIRE! FIRE!"</p>

  <h3>1:15 PM</h3>

  <p>Development Standards Committee calls and complains about umlauts
  in form names. Apologizing for the inconvenience, I tell them I will
  fix it. Hang up and run global search/replace using gaks.

  <h3>1:20 PM</h3>

  <p>Mary Hairnet from cafeteria calls. Says she keeps getting calls
  for "Notice Loads" or "NoLoad Goats," she's not sure, couldn't hear
  over industrial grade blender. Tell her it was probably "Lettuce
  Nodes." Maybe the food distributor with a new product? She thinks
  about it and hangs up.</p>

  <h3>2:00 PM</h3>

  <p>Legal secretary calls and says she lost password. Ask her to
  check in her purse, floor of car, and on bathroom counter. Tell her
  it probably fell out of back of machine. Suggest she put duct tape
  over all the air vents she can find on the PC. Grudgingly offer to
  create new ID for her while she does that.</p>

  <h3>2:49 PM</h3>

  <p>Janitor comes back. Wants more lessons. I take off rest of day.

  <h2>Wednesday</h2>

  <h3>8:30 PM</h3>

  <p>Irate user calls to say chipset has nothing to do with fonts on
  form. Tell them "Of course, they should have been checking 'Bitset,'
  not 'chipset.'" Sheepish user apologizes and hangs up.</p>

  <h3>9:10 PM</h3>

  <p>Support manager, with foot in cast, returns to office. Schedules
  10:00 AM meeting with me. User calls and wants to talk to support
  manager about terrible help at support desk. Tell them my manager and
  I about are about to go into meeting. Sometimes life hands you 
  material...</p>

  <h3>10:00 AM</h3>

  <p>Call Louie in janitorial services to cover for me. Go to support
  manager's office. He says he can't dismiss me but can suggest
  several lateral career moves. Most involve farm implements in third
  world countries with moderate to heavy political turmoil. By and by,
  I ask if he's aware of new bug which takes full text indexed random
  e-mail databases and puts all references to furry handcuffs and
  Bambi Boomer in Marketing on the corporate Web page.  Meeting is
  adjourned as he reaches for keyboard, Web browser, and Tums.</p>

  <h3>10:30 AM</h3>

  <p>Tell Louie he's doing great job. Offer to show him mainframe
  corporate PBX system sometime.</p>

  <h3>11:00 AM</h3>

  <p>Lunch.</p>

  <h3>4:55 PM</h3>

  <p>Return from lunch.</p>

  <h3>5:00 PM</h3>

  <p>Shift change; Going home.</p>

  <h2>Thursday</h2>

  <h3>8:00 AM</h3>

  <p>New guy, Marvin, started today. "Nice plaids" I offer. Show him
  server room, wiring closet, and technical library. Set him up with
  IBM PC-XT. Tell him to quit whining, Notes runs the same in both
  monochrome and color.</p>

  <h3>8:45 AM</h3>

  <p>New guy's PC finishes booting up. Tell him I'll create new ID for
  him. Set minimum password length to 64. Go grab smoke.</p>

  <h3>9:30 AM</h3>

  <p>Introduce Louie the custodian to Marvin. "Nice plaids" Louie
  comments. Is this guy great or what?!</p>

  <h3>11:00 AM</h3>

  <p>Beat Louie in dominos game. Louie leaves. Fish spare dominos out
  of sleeves ("Always have backups"). User calls, says Accounting
  server is down. Untie Ethernet cable from radio antenna (better
  reception) and plug back into hub. Tell user to try again. Another
  happy customer!</p>

  <h3>11:55 AM</h3>

  <p>Brief Marvin on Corporate Policy 98.022.01: "Whereas all new
  employee beginning on days ending in 'Y' shall enjoy all proper
  aspects with said corporation, said employee is obligated to provide
  sustenance and relief to senior technical analyst on shift." Marvin
  doubts. I point to Corporate Policy database (a fine piece of work,
  if I say so myself!). "Remember, that's DOUBLE pepperoni and NO
  peppers!" I yell to Marvin as he steps over open floor tile to get
  to exit door.</p>

 <h3>1:00 PM</h3>

  <p>Oooooh! Pizza makes me so sleepy...</p>

  <h3>4:30 PM</h3>

  <p>Wake from refreshing nap. Catch Marvin scanning want ads.</p>

  <h3>5:00 PM</h3>

  <p>Shift change. Flick HR's server off and on several times (just
  testing the On/Off button...). See ya tomorrow.</p>

  <h2>Friday</h2>

  <h3>8:00 AM</h3>

  <p>Night shift still trying to replace power supply in HR
  server. Told them it worked fine before I left.</p>

  <h3>9:00 AM</h3>

  <p>Marvin still not here. Decide I might start answering these calls
  myself. Unforward phones from Mailroom.</p>

  <h3>9:02 AM</h3>

  <p>Yep. A user call. Users in Des Moines can't replicate. Me and the
  Ouija board determine it's sunspots. Tell them to call
  Telecommunications.</p>

  <h3>9:30 AM</h3>

  <p>Good grief, another user! They're like ants. Says he's in San
  Diego and can't replicate with Des Moines. Tell him it's sunspots,
  but with a two hour difference. Suggest he reset the time on the
  server back two hours.</p>

  <h3>10:17 AM</h3>

  <p>Pensacola calls. Says they can't route mail to San Diego. Tell
  them to set server ahead three hours.</p>

  <h3>11:00 AM</h3>

  <p>E-mail from corporate says for everybody to quit resetting the
  time on their servers. I change the date stamp and forward it to
  Milwaukee.</p>

  <p>Finish @CoffeeMake macro. Put phone back on hook.</p>

  hard to get good help..." I respond. Support manager says he has
  appointment with orthopedic doctor this afternoon, and asks if I
  mind sitting in on the weekly department head meeting for him. "No
  problem!"</p>

  <h3>11:30 AM</h3>

  <p>Call Louie and tell him opportunity knocks and he's invited to a
  meeting this afternoon. "Yeah, sure. You can bring your snuff" I
  tell him.</p>

  <h3>12:00 PM</h3>

  <p>Lunch.</p>

  <h3>1:00 PM</h3>

  <p>Start full backups on Unix server. Route them to device /dev/null
  to make them fast.</p>

  <h3>1:03 PM</h3>

  <p>Full weekly backups done. Man, I love modern technology!</p>

  <h3>2:30 PM</h3>

  <p>Look in support manager's contact management database. Cancel

  you know.</p>

  set point size to "2" in help databases.</p>

  <h3>4:30 PM</h3>

  <p>User calls to say they can't see anything in documents. Tell them
  to go to view, do a <b>Edit: Select All</b>, hit delete key, and
  then refresh. Promise to send them document addendum which says
  so.</p>

  <h3>4:45 PM</h3>

  them I'll fix it. Hang up. Change font to Wing dings.</p>

  (too) much.</p>
