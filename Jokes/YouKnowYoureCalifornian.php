  <p>So as not to be outdone by all the redneck, hillbilly, and Texan jokes, 
  you know you're from California if:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Your co-worker has 8 body piercings and none are visible.</li>

    <li>You make over $300,000 and still can't afford a house.</li>

    <li>You take a bus and are shocked at two people carrying on a 
    conversation in English.</li>

    <li>Your child's 3rd-grade teacher has purple hair, a nose ring, 
    and is named Flower.</li>

    <li>You can't remember . . is pot illegal?</li>

    <li>You've been to a baby shower that has two mothers and a sperm 
    donor.</li>

    <li>You have a very strong opinion about where your coffee beans 
    are grown, and you can taste the difference between Sumatran and
    Ethiopian.</li>

    <li>A really great parking space can totally move you to tears.</li>

    <li>Gas costs $1.00 per gallon more than anywhere else in the
    U.S.</li>

    <li>Unlike back home, the guy at 8:30 am at Starbucks wearing a 
    baseball cap and sunglasses who looks like George Clooney really 
    <b>is</b> George Clooney.

    <li>Your car insurance costs as much as your house payment.</li>

    <li>It's barely sprinkling rain and there's a report on every
    news station: <b><i>Storm Watch</i></b>.</li>

    <li>You pass an elementary school playground and the children 
    are all busy with their cells or pagers.</li>

    <li>It's barely sprinkling rain outside, so you leave for work 
    an hour early to avoid all the weather-related accidents.</li>

    <li>Both you <b>and</b> your dog have therapists.</li>

    <li><i>The Terminator</i> <b>is</b> your governor.</li>

    <li>If you drive illegally, they take your driver's license. 
    If you're here illegally, they want to give you one.</li>
  </ul>
