<font face="Freehand591 BT"><font color="#FFFFCC"><font size=+2>This
is my interpretation of this song and is subject to lots of things including
what I was going through at the time. Yours may differ. Understand that
I had recently separated with my wife and had taking a trip to Death Valley
just to get away from it all for a while. I had enjoyed singing this song
often in the past as it has a nice melody and the like but had not really
given the lyrics much thought. On the surface it seems like a song about
holding on to your current love.</font></font></font><font face="Freehand591 BT"><font color="#FFFFCC"><font size=+2></font></font></font>
<p><font face="Freehand591 BT"><font color="#FFFFCC"><font size=+2>I had
thought that I had lost this tape. I was almost back to San Jose when I
had popped in this unlabeled tape and had immediately recognized it. But
when this song came on I was hit like a lightening bolt as I finally realized
the relevance of the lyrics to my particular situation. So much so I had
to pull over and with tears streaming down my face I just had to record
the lyrics. Doesn't sound that traumatic now but it had real impact then.Here's
my take on it:</font></font></font>

<b><font face="Freehand591 BT"><font size=+2>There you have it, you see
this love regretting</font></font></b>
<blockquote><font face="Freehand591 BT"><font color="#FFFFCC"><font size=+2>Right
off the bat this seems strange. Why are you regretting love? Isn't love
supposed to be cherished?</font></font></font></blockquote>
<b><font face="Freehand591 BT"><font size=+2>Something's wrong again,</font></font></b>
<blockquote><font face="Freehand591 BT"><font color="#FFFFCC"><font size=+2>Something's
not going right. As in my case this reflected the constant problems that
I had had with my wife.</font></font></font></blockquote>
<b><font face="Freehand591 BT"><font size=+2>but you had it in the palm
of your hands</font></font></b>
<blockquote><font face="Freehand591 BT"><font color="#FFFFCC"><font size=+2>You
thought that you had been in love and that you wouldn't be having problems
but you are.</font></font></font></blockquote>
<b><font face="Freehand591 BT"><font size=+2>Your heart has starting bleeding</font></font></b>
<blockquote><font face="Freehand591 BT"><font color="#FFFFCC"><font size=+2>Your
heart hurts. There's constant pain from something that should be giving
you constant pleasure - love.</font></font></font></blockquote>
<b><font face="Freehand591 BT"><font size=+2>gotta get out believing</font></font></b>
<br><b><font face="Freehand591 BT"><font size=+2>You're on your own forever,</font></font></b>
<blockquote><font face="Freehand591 BT"><font size=+2><font color="#FFFFCC">No
matter what you do you will always be with yourself. This, to me, is a
statement of recognition that you have to realize that you will always
be with you - and that you are broke - right now. Not very happy with yourself
and you have low self esteem</font><b>.</b></font></font></blockquote>
<b><font face="Freehand591 BT"><font size=+2>it's not the space or time
or weather</font></font></b>
<blockquote><font face="Freehand591 BT"><font color="#FFFFCC"><font size=+2>At
the time I had just been to Death Valley. There's a lot of space out there!
Including the space I was trying to achieve by going away from my problems
for a while. The time I spent doing this, while refreshing, didn't solve
the problems.</font></font></font></blockquote>
<b><font face="Freehand591 BT"><font color="#33CCFF"><font size=+2>(Chorus
1)</font></font></font></b><b><font face="Freehand591 BT"><font size=+2></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Freehand591 BT"><font size=+2>You can leave</font></font></b>
<blockquote><font face="Freehand591 BT"><font color="#FFFFCC"><font size=+2>Yes
I can take off - but it won't solve the problem.</font></font></font></blockquote>
<b><font face="Freehand591 BT"><font size=+2>You want - you can't have</font></font></b>
<blockquote><font face="Freehand591 BT"><font color="#FFFFCC"><font size=+2>I'd
like to have a loving relationship. But merely wanting it doesn't make
it come into being.</font></font></font></blockquote>
<b><font face="Freehand591 BT"><font size=+2>You need - you can't touch</font></font></b>
<blockquote><font face="Freehand591 BT"><font color="#FFFFCC"><font size=+2>I
really felt I needed to relate to someone and to feel the warmth of human
contact - the reassurance that I'm worth something to somebody. But I couldn't
simply reach out and touch anybody.</font></font></font></blockquote>
<b><font face="Freehand591 BT"><font size=+2>You plead it's enough it's
enough</font></font></b>
<blockquote><font face="Freehand591 BT"><font color="#FFFFCC"><font size=+2>You
get desperate and wonder why you just can't seem to connect with anybody.
You want it to stop and for things to be good again.</font></font></font></blockquote>
<b><font face="Freehand591 BT"><font size=+2>There's something happening
to ya</font></font></b>
<blockquote><font face="Freehand591 BT"><font color="#FFFFCC"><font size=+2>You
sense something changing - a reckoning, revelation or insight.</font></font></font></blockquote>
<b><font face="Freehand591 BT"><font size=+2>Love can see right through
ya</font></font></b>
<blockquote><font face="Freehand591 BT"><font color="#FFFFCC"><font size=+2>Though
you wonder why nobody seems to see your worth, there are other lovely people
who are picking up on the fact that you are in the process of changing,
blossoming once again.</font></font></font></blockquote>
<b><font face="Freehand591 BT"><font size=+2>In a world of make believe</font></font></b>
<blockquote><font face="Freehand591 BT"><font color="#FFFFCC"><font size=+2>In
the fantasy world, as portrayed by Hollywood and incurable romantics as
love, you have felt like it is some make believe thing that you either
just don't get or that is unreal. You want to give up on it.</font></font></font></blockquote>
<b><font face="Freehand591 BT"><font size=+2>Don't go throwing it all away</font></font></b>
<blockquote><font face="Freehand591 BT"><font color="#FFFFCC"><font size=+2>Wait!
There may be some hope!</font></font></font></blockquote>
<b><font face="Freehand591 BT"><font size=+2>Hold on to love - hold on
to love</font></font></b>
<blockquote><font face="Freehand591 BT"><font size=+2><font color="#FFFFCC">Hold
on to the </font><font color="#FFFF00">concept</font> <font color="#FFFFCC">of
love!</font></font></font></blockquote>
<b><font face="Freehand591 BT"><font size=+2>Treat it as a good thing</font></font></b>
<blockquote><font face="Freehand591 BT"><font color="#FFFFCC"><font size=+2>It
is not something to see as bad - rather good!</font></font></font></blockquote>
<b><font face="Freehand591 BT"><font size=+2>Be always ready with that
electric feeling</font></font></b>
<blockquote><font face="Freehand591 BT"><font color="#FFFFCC"><font size=+2>Isn't
it electric when love starts? Are you ready for it?</font></font></font></blockquote>
<b><font face="Freehand591 BT"><font size=+2>You work so hard - to be in
love with her</font></font></b>
<blockquote><font face="Freehand591 BT"><font color="#FFFFCC"><font size=+2>Again
here, with reference to my situation, I do believe that I did work hard
trying to save the relationship and get the love back. But you can't get
the love back just because you want it to be there and fear that it is
not. In the end the love went away and I didn't want to admit that.</font></font></font></blockquote>
<b><font face="Freehand591 BT"><font size=+2>She tried so hard</font></font></b>
<blockquote><font face="Freehand591 BT"><font color="#FFFFCC"><font size=+2>This
is a statement of recognition that my wife also made an effort (there's
two sides to every story). That she wanted and tried to make it work. But
you can't force love to be between two people.</font></font></font></blockquote>
<b><font face="Freehand591 BT"><font size=+2>you gotta let it go</font></font></b>
<blockquote><font face="Freehand591 BT"><font color="#FFFFCC"><font size=+2>It's
time to let go of it!</font></font></font></blockquote>
<b><font face="Freehand591 BT"><font size=+2>Hold on - hold on</font></font></b>
<br><b><font face="Freehand591 BT"><font size=+2>Hold on - hold on</font></font></b>
<blockquote><font face="Freehand591 BT"><font color="#FFFFCC"><font size=+2>Here's
another example of contradiction. He just said let it go and now he's saying
hold on! What's he talking as about? My take is that you gotta hold on
to the concept of love and you gotta hold on because you're going through
a roller coaster ride! It's interesting to note that the background music
is whirling around probably much like your mind whirls around whilst going
through this. It did for me. This whirling music slows down at the end
to a cadence.</font></font></font></blockquote>
<b><font face="Freehand591 BT"><font size=+2>The more and more you hear
it</font></font></b>
<br><b><font face="Freehand591 BT"><font size=+2>The more it seems to make
sense</font></font></b>
<blockquote><font face="Freehand591 BT"><font color="#FFFFCC"><font size=+2>How
many times do you hear that you gotta love yourself first? You start hearing
it a lot when you've separated and are in the process of rebuilding. Nonetheless
you eventually start recognizing to what degree you do love yourself and
start addressing what you need to fix to love yourself more. You swear
you try to never lose yourself again.</font></font></font></blockquote>
<b><font face="Freehand591 BT"><font size=+2>To hold love in the palm of
you're hand</font></font></b>
<blockquote><font face="Freehand591 BT"><font color="#FFFFCC"><font size=+2>If
you're really holding love in the palm of your hand then you are loving
yourself. You'll always have yourself. Therefore you'll always be in love.
Loving others will come and go and it is indeed nice. But the key is to
have this self love and not lose it.</font></font></font></blockquote>
<b><font face="Freehand591 BT"><font size=+2>But you think that 'round
the corner</font></font></b>
<br><b><font face="Freehand591 BT"><font size=+2>You queuing up to hold
her</font></font></b>
<blockquote><font face="Freehand591 BT"><font color="#FFFFCC"><font size=+2>I
was in and out of an affair with another women. At the time it was out.
One thing on my mind was whether or not I would be able to re-establish
this relationship with this other woman.</font></font></font></blockquote>
<b><font face="Freehand591 BT"><font size=+2>But that won't make a difference
in the end</font></font></b>
<blockquote><font face="Freehand591 BT"><font color="#FFFFCC"><font size=+2>But
that is irrelevant - immaterial - I have to get to the point where I love
myself again.</font></font></font></blockquote>
