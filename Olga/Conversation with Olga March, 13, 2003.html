<h3>On March 13, 2003:</h3>
<br>
<font color="#33ccff"><font color="#3366ff">Olga DeFaria:</font> </font>I
thought of "Unlawful Entry" But i know that you don't really&nbsp; like to
wach video tapes. There is also Home alone 2 if you are interested in that.<br>
<font color="#33ccff"><font color="#3366ff">Olga DeFaria:</font> </font>Are
you interested in any of this movie?<br>
<font color="#33ccff"><font color="#3366ff">Olga DeFaria:</font>&nbsp;</font>
I gess you are not there.<br>
<font color="#33ccff"><font color="#3366ff">Olga DeFaria:</font> </font>Are
you there?<br>
<font color="#ff0000">*** Auto-response sent to Olga DeFaria: I am currently
idle.</font><br>
<font color="#33ccff"><font color="#3366ff">Olga DeFaria:</font> </font>You
know I am really looking forward to make up, and work things out.I miss you.
You were in my dream lest night it&nbsp; was a beautiful dream.<br>
<font color="#ff6666">Andrew DeFaria: </font>I went to lunch. Sorry. I'm
a little more interested in "Eye for an eye" but I think Home Alone 2 would
be best.<br>
<font color="#ff6666">Andrew DeFaria: </font>Sorry I woke you. <br>
<font color="#ff6666">Andrew DeFaria: </font>I didn't know if you even want
to make up or not. Last I heard you want a break and a divorce. What am I
supposed to do with such statements except keep away?<br>
<font color="#33ccff"><font color="#3366ff">Olga DeFaria:</font> </font>I
do want, and I&nbsp; really want things work out..<br>
<font color="#33ccff"><font color="#3366ff">Olga DeFaria:</font> </font>I
think "Eye for an&nbsp; eye" would be good I haven't seen that movie.<br>
<font color="#ff0000">*** Auto-response sent to Olga DeFaria: I am currently
idle.</font><br>
<font color="#33ccff"><font color="#3366ff">Olga DeFaria:</font> </font>tee<br>
<font color="#ff6666">Andrew DeFaria: </font>If you want to make up then
I need to you do a few things for me.<br>
<font color="#33ccff"><font color="#3366ff">Olga DeFaria:</font> </font>&nbsp;What
things? Do you want to make up?<br>
<font color="#ff6666">Andrew DeFaria: </font>I have always said, since we
started fighting this Monday, that I want to make up and work things out.<br>
<font color="#ff6666">Andrew DeFaria: </font>First I need to you say that
you don't want to get a divorce.<br>
<font color="#ff6666">Andrew DeFaria: </font>I'm tired of that threat.<br>
<font color="#33ccff"><font color="#3366ff">Olga DeFaria:</font> </font>I
DON'T WANT TO GET A DIVORCE"<br>
<font color="#ff6666">Andrew DeFaria: </font>Next I need you to admit that
opening a car door at 60 MPH is dangerous and the wrong thing to do in any
situation (unless you are physically being attacked - which you weren't).<br>
Andrew DeFaria: I need you to say that your sorry for that behavior and that
it will not happen again.<br>
<font color="#33ccff"><font color="#3366ff">Olga DeFaria:</font> </font>I
AM VERY SORRY FOR&nbsp; THAT BEHAVIOR I SHOULD NOT HAVE DONE THAT. I PROMISE
IT WILL NOT HAPPEN AGAIN.<br>
<font color="#ff0000">*** Auto-response sent to Olga DeFaria: I just went
to the bathroom. Be back shortly...</font><br>
Andrew DeFaria: I need you to admit that grabbing the steering wheel of a
car traveling at 60 MPH from the passengers seat in an attempt to turn is
off the road is dangerous and the wrong thing to do and that you promise
you will not do that again.<br>
<font color="#33ccff"><font color="#3366ff">Olga DeFaria:</font> </font>It
is very dangerous opening a car door at 60 MPH and on a freeway<br>
<font color="#33ccff"><font color="#3366ff">Olga DeFaria:</font> </font>And
it was wrong of me to do that.<br>
<font color="#ff6666">Andrew DeFaria: </font>I need to to promise that you
will not continue to threaten to commit suicide or otherwise harm yourself
or anybody else. This sort of behavior is also dangerous and not acceptable.<br>
<font color="#33ccff"><font color="#3366ff">Olga DeFaria:</font> </font>I
opologise againg that it was wrong of me .<br>
<font color="#ff6666">Andrew DeFaria: </font>Do you promise not to continue
to threaten to commit suicide or otherwise harm yourself or anybody else?<br>
<font color="#33ccff"><font color="#3366ff">Olga DeFaria:</font> </font>I
am sorry I promise&nbsp; I will never do such things againg.<br>
<font color="#ff6666">Andrew DeFaria: </font>OK. Is there anything you need
from me?<br>
<font color="#33ccff"><font color="#3366ff">Olga DeFaria:</font> </font>I
do.<br>
<font color="#33ccff"><font color="#3366ff">Olga DeFaria:</font> </font>Like
what? The one thing I am sure of;&nbsp;&nbsp; I need your hug, your kiss
and all of you home.<br>
<font color="#ff6666">Andrew DeFaria: </font>I was just thinking that I made
a few demands of you, reasonable demands IMHO, and that perhaps you might
have a few demands too.<br>
<font color="#ff6666">Andrew DeFaria: </font>You sure seem to have a lot
to complain about when we fight. One would think you might want to do something
about the things that bother you and ask me for some changes.<br>
<font color="#ff6666">Andrew DeFaria: </font>But if you don't then that's
your choice too.<br>
<font color="#33ccff"><font color="#3366ff">Olga DeFaria:</font> </font>OK.
I agree.Olga DeFaria: That would be best.<br>
<font color="#ff6666">Andrew DeFaria: </font>You agree to what and what would
be best?<br>
<font color="#33ccff"><font color="#3366ff">Olga DeFaria:</font> </font>If
the things you do are bothering me I'll&nbsp; tell you and ask you for some
changes in them.<br>
<font color="#ff6666">Andrew DeFaria: </font>So then you are saying that
right now you have no requests.Andrew DeFaria: Is that a yes or a no or an
"I'<br>
<font color="#ff6666">Andrew DeFaria: </font>Or an "I'm thinking about it"?<br>
<font color="#33ccff"><font color="#3366ff">Olga DeFaria:</font> </font>I
have a request that I really don like when you talk about me to MA. If you
want to say somethink about me may be you can talk to me first and to hear
what I think about it.<br>
<font color="#ff6666">Andrew DeFaria: </font>I find it very unrealistic that
I must "clear" all my conversations to MA with you first. Olga DeFaria: And
it is not just MA. any body.<br>
<font color="#33ccff"><font color="#3366ff">Olga DeFaria:</font> </font>Why.<br>
<font color="#ff6666">Andrew DeFaria: </font>I'm sorry but I can't do that.
That it just too unrealistic and insecure. I do not ask that you clear your
thoughts with me before talking to any of your friends.Olga DeFaria: What
do you mean conversation.<br>
<font color="#ff6666">Andrew DeFaria: </font>A conversation is when people
talk, they are having a conversation.<br>
<font color="#33ccff"><font color="#3366ff">Olga DeFaria:</font> </font>I
am not talking about you&nbsp; to my friends.<br>
<font color="#33ccff"><font color="#3366ff">Olga DeFaria:</font> </font>So
then here is nothing for me to say.<br>
<font color="#ff6666">Andrew DeFaria: </font>That doesn't matter - I do not
restrict your freedom of expression. It is unrealistic to stifle somebody
in such a manner. <br>
<font color="#ff6666">Andrew DeFaria: </font>Well if you continue to request
unrealistic things for reasons only you can understand then there is nothing
for me to do either.<br>
<font color="#33ccff"><font color="#3366ff">Olga DeFaria:</font> </font>Then
I gess I'll have a conversation with people about you.<br>
<font color="#ff6666">Andrew DeFaria: </font>Never said you couldn't.<br>
<font color="#33ccff"><font color="#3366ff">Olga DeFaria:</font> </font>And
wee will se then.<br>
<font color="#ff6666">Andrew DeFaria: </font>What are we looking for?<br>
<font color="#33ccff"><font color="#3366ff">Olga DeFaria:</font> </font>How
do you feel about it.<br>
<font color="#ff6666">Andrew DeFaria: </font>I have no problem with it -
as long as it's the truth.<br>
<font color="#33ccff"><font color="#3366ff">Olga DeFaria:</font> </font>Fine
then.<br>
<font color="#ff6666">Andrew DeFaria: </font>And not your opinion of the
truth but the facts.<br>
<font color="#33ccff"><font color="#3366ff">Olga DeFaria:</font> </font>I
do not anderstand your sentence<br>
<font color="#ff6666">Andrew DeFaria: </font>I do not have a problem with
you stating facts. I would very much have a problem with you stating your
opinion of the facts as if they were facts when in reality they are just
your perception of the situation.<br>
<font color="#33ccff"><font color="#3366ff">Olga DeFaria:</font> </font>What
is stating your opinion? and what is perception?<br>
<font color="#ff6666">Andrew DeFaria: </font>"Stating your opinion" in this
context means stating what you think, not necessarily stating the facts.
Opinions are people beliefs and do not require a basis in fact. For example,
I like "red" while you like "blue".<br>
<font color="#33ccff"><font color="#3366ff">Olga DeFaria:</font> </font>When
in reality they are just my<br>
<font color="#ff6666">Andrew DeFaria: </font>"perception" is somebody's view
point. In other words what they see. Again it is not necessarily based in
facts nor the truth, rather is it just how somebody sees something.<br>
<font color="#ff6666">Andrew DeFaria: </font>Spreading "opinions" and "perceptions"
is gossip. Spreading facts is news.<br>
<font color="#33ccff"><font color="#3366ff">Olga DeFaria:</font> </font>Well
then I have nothing to say any more.<br>
<font color="#ff6666">Andrew DeFaria: </font>I thought that we might be making
up but you seem content on continuing to argue. Oh well, at least, if your
promises were truthful, I feel a little safer.<br>
