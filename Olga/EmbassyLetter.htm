  To whom it may concern,<br>
 <br>
  My name is Andrew DeFaria and I am a United States Citizen living in San
 Jose, California. I am inviting Olga Fedoryaka to Jamaica from 24 March
2002  until 3 April 2002. I will be paying for all of the flights and hotel
accommodations  for Olga during this trip. We will be staying at:<br>
<blockquote>Point Village<br>
Rutland Point <br>
P.O. Box 105, Negril <br>
Toll Free From The US: (877) POINTJA <br>
Toll Free From The UK 0 -800 328-7790 <br>
(876) 957-5170-9 <br>
Facsimile: (876)957-5351 or 5113 <br>
  </blockquote>
during our stay at a price of approximately $190 per night for 8 nights.
This trip is for pleasure only and Olga will be returning to Kiev. Olga will
supply you with a travel itinerary from Kiev to London to Montego Bay, Jamaica
with a return from Kingston to London to Kiev. Since Olga will be in London
for more than 24 hours connecting flights  she will need a transit visa.
Not shown on the itinerary is an overnight stay in Gatwick.at the Gatwick
Belmont at Horley, Surrey, RH67DS.<br>
 <br>
 As per our lovely telephone conversation I am sending proof of my income 
showing how much I make a year and the fact that have recieved a rather large 
refund from my taxes ($4,638.00 from Federal taxes and $1941.00 from California 
State taxes totaling $6579.00) which is more than enough to finance this
trip. This will come in a subsequent fax (shortly).<br>
 <br>
  Please let us know if Olga will be able to obtain a transit visa in advance
 of us purchasing these non refundable tickets. If you have any problems
or  questions feel free to call or email me at the above address.<br>
 <br>
  Very truly yours,<br>
