<p><small>Dear INS:</small></p>
        <small> </small>        
<p><small><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"></font></small></p>
 
<p><small>I have a K-1 visa fiance who lives in your office's jurisdiction 
and will soon be filing her application for permanent resident status with 
your office. I believe that the INS official at the port of entry said that
they forwarded our paperwork to the San Francisco office even though we live
in San Jose..Please let me know if we should be dealing with that office
instead. I am therefore writing your office for clarification about filing 
an application for permanent resident status through your office for persons 
who entered the United States under a K-1 fianc&eacute;e visa and who perform 
the marriage ceremony within 90 days of entry. My questions are as follows:</small></p>
    
<p><small>1. If the fianc&eacute;e did not receive a temporary 90 day work 
stamp on her I-94 at the point of entry (most points of entry no longer give 
this stamp), can she come into your office before the marriage and before
 filing the application for permanent resident status, and file an I-765
(without filing fee) under category (a)(6) and obtain a temporary EAD that
will be good for the remainder of her first 90 days from the date of her
entry?</small></p>
    
<p><small>2. On March 7th, 2000, Michael D. Cronin, the Acting Associate Commissioner
for the INS's Office of Programs issued a memo to the field discussing aspects
of the I-864 affidavit of support. The subject of that memo was the clarification
of the INS policy concerning the I-864, and specifically when it must be
filed. Mr. Cronin states that the affidavit of support is only enforceable
at the time the adjustment of status application is "approved", not at the
time the form I-485 is filed. However, the memo also goes on to state that
if any particular INS office requests that the I-864 be filed at the time
of filing the application for adjustment, it may do so by accepting a signed
I-864 that need not meet the eligibility requirements. In other words, an
INS District of Suboffice may request a signed I-864 at the time the I-485
is filed, but it cannot require the sponsor to document eligibility as a
sponsor until the time the application for adjustment is adjudicated. Can
you please elaborate on your office's policy as to whether you will require 
the I-864 at the time the I-485 is filed, and if so, will you accept a "skeletal" 
I-864, meaning that it is fully completed and signed/notarized, but other 
financial documentation such as tax returns, w2's, employment letters are 
not included and instead brought to the adjustment interview by the applicant?</small></p>
    
<p><small>3. Since the March 7th, 2000 "Cronin" memo indicates that the I-864 
is only enforceable at the time the adjustment application is "approved", 
this brings up the issue of when the I-865 sponsor's change of address form 
must be submitted. Must I submit an I-865 change of address form between the
date the I-485 is filed and before approval of the I-485, or will the  I-865
sponsor's change of address form only be required after the adjustment application
is approved? (Even if the answer is that the I-865 only needs to be filed
after the adjustment is approved, I assure you that I will always notify
your office via certified mail of any change of address for the sponsor and
the international spouse at any time during which the I-864 is still binding
on the sponsor).</small></p>
    
<p><small>4. I am hearing reports about some INS offices immediately adjudicating 
adjustment of status adjudication for K-1 beneficiaries (Dallas &amp; Detroit 
INS for example). Does your office also offer immediate adjudication of adjustment 
of status for K-1 beneficiaries?</small></p>
    
<p><small>5. I notice that the instructions for the latest version of the 
I-485 (Rev. 02/07/00 N) indicate that if a K-1 fianc&eacute;e beneficiary 
had a medical exam within the past year as required for the fianc&eacute;e 
visa, a new medical examination will not be required at the time of filing 
the adjustment paperwork (please confirm your office's policy on this issue); 
however due to processing times at many INS District and Suboffices, the prior
medical exam will be over a year old by the time of the adjustment approval.
If the prior medical exam is over a year old at the time of the adjustment
interview, will my client be required to bring to the interview the results
of a new medical examination on an I-693 in a sealed envelope? </small></p>
    
<p><small>6. I have noticed that some INS offices do not require the submission 
of a $25.00 fingerprinting fee because the international fianc&eacute;e, now
spouse, went through the fingerprinting process at the time of her fianc&eacute;e 
visa interview at the U.S. Consulate. Will I need to submit a $25.00 fingerprinting 
fee when I submit her application for permanent resident status to your office?</small></p>
    
<p><small>7. Some INS offices now require payment of the INS filing fees by
a certified bank check or money order while other INS offices still accept 
a check drafted from the attorney's bank account or from the client's bank 
account. What is the fee payment policy for applications filed through your
 office?</small></p>
    
<p><small>8. Can my client bring in the completed adjustment of status application 
package into your office for "in person" filing, or must I submit this application
 to your office through the mail?</small></p>
    
<p><small>9. How long is it currently taking between the date I file the application
for permanent resident status with your office and the date the foreign spouse
will be called in to process her employment authorization card?</small></p>
    
<p><small>10. How long is it currently taking your office to schedule the 
spousal interview after the adjustment paperwork is filed?</small></p>
    
<p><small>11. If an I-131 application for advanced parole is submitted along 
with the adjustment package, how long does it usually take to issue the advanced 
parole in a "non-emergency" situation?</small></p>
    
<p><small>12. Finally, if an I-131 application for advanced parole is filed 
sometime after the adjustment application is filed, must the applicant file 
her I-131 "in person" with your office and will your office mail the approved
 I-512 parole document directly to the applicant's home address, or will
she be required to pick up the I-512 "in person" at your office (I understand 
and have warned my client that she must not depart the United States until 
after she has been issued the I-512, but I just want to confirm your office's 
advanced parole "filing" and "pick up" process)?</small></p>
    
<p><small>If your office uses a special cover sheet or ADIT sheet for submissions 
of applications for permanent resident status, will you please send me this 
material. Thank you for your attention to these questions.</small></p>
