  <title>Response to fax from INS (949-389-3486) on 1/14/2002</title>
</head>
<body>
You wrote (faxed):<br>
<blockquote>We have responded to your many inquires regarding the above petition.
We have informed you that you &nbsp;are sending your inquires to a Division
that does not handle I-129F petitions. We are unable to assist you in this
matter. PLEASE FORWARD YOUR INQUIRES TO FAX: 949-389-3402. <br>
  </blockquote>
And then further wrote:<br>
  <blockquote>Sir, Please note that you are sending your inquiry to the wrong
division. If you fax to 949-389-3402 they will be able to assist you.</blockquote>
I would like to respond. First off, <b>no </b>you have <b>not </b>responded
to my inquires! You have not addressed a single issue contained in my faxes!
And no you have not informed me that I was sending my inquires to a division
that does not handle I-129F petitions. All I got was a vague message on my
answering machine from somebody in INS who <b>failed to identify himself</b>
 simply telling me to forward future faxes to 949-389-3402. <b>He did not
tell me that his division does not handle I-129F petitions</b> - he did not
even identify himself let alone what division he might be a part of nor did
he happen to mention what fax number he was representing. I do not have telepathic
abilities! Your number is not the only fax number I've been faxing (ask around)
and guess what? 949-389-3402 happens to be one of the many fax numbers that
    <b>I am already faxing!</b> In fact to date I've sent them <b>69 faxes!</b>
 (Wait a second! Make that 70!) And they have not responded to a single one
of them! Do you have any idea of why an otherwise rational person would be
a little upset?<br>
    <br>
I got your fax number from the National Visa Service Center and they specifically
told me that if I was not getting a response regarding my issue then I should
fax these numbers. I did so in the summer of 2001. I did so again around
October and again in the November/December time frame. I never received a
response from any of the fax numbers I was given. To blatantly ignore somebody's
honest and polite question is just downright rude! To continue to ignore
the inquires when the issue is as important to the inquirer as is the case
here where I am being forcefully impeded from being with my loved one is,
in my book, downright criminal!<br>
    <br>
I suggest that you contact the National Visa Service Center and tell them
that you do not handle I-129F petitions so that if in the future another
person like me calls they will not be instructed to fax you for an I-129F
issue. <br>
    <br>
I will stop faxing when I get a satisfactory response to my inquiry. I am
in San Jose. You are in Laguna Niguel and the people at 949-389-3402 are
in Laguna Niguel and just so happen to work for the same government agency
as you do! As such I would think that it much more possible for your to get
the people at 949-329-3402 to <b>answer and respond to their damn faxes</b>
 than for me. Just take a little walk over to that area and ask them why
they refuse to respond. And who knows, maybe then the faxing will stop! <br>
    <br>
Have a nice day...<br>
