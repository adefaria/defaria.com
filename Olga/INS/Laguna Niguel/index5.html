<p><small><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Today, December 17, 2001 
I spoke to John Serra at the CSC. He advised me to send this fax. He said 
that the "P" file was in some workstation and apparently the "A" file was 
in Phoenix. He said I should mention that my petition was approved way back
on January 2, 2001 and that I was present at the interview in Warsaw on April
23, 2001 when the consular officer said he was returning the petition to
the CSC. As stated above the petition was traced back to Dulles Air Force
Base on May 22, 2001. I do not know how to trace it further. The petition
is stuck somewhere in the CSC, probably waiting for the "A" file or something
like that. I have already been to my Congressman and my Senators but they
have been unable to help locate the file. I've been through several immigration
attorneys and none of them have been able to get status of my petition although
one managed to get FIOA files for both me and my fianc&eacute;e. I see no
reason why I should be delayed in starting my family with my fianc&eacute;e
from the FIOA files. I have faxed several times in the past to no avail.
I've even driven 10 hours down to Laguna Niguel and was told nothing. It's
been 8 months now and as far as I can see my returned petition is just sitting
there not being processed and nobody knows why. John Serra verified for me
that my petition is stuck and John does not know why it is not going forward
so he suggested that I fax the Assistant Center Directory. Please, please,
I beg of you! Please find out for me why my petition has not even been acknowledged
of being received back by the CSC and why it is not being processed right
now. I feel I've waited patiently enough and that my petition should be being
processed by somebody there at this moment. John mentioned that you are currently
processing petitions from November 5, 2001 so I would suspect that my petition
should be processed immediately!</font></small></p>
<p></p>
<p><small>John also says I should request notification that my petition has
been received and that my petition is being processed.</small></p>
<p><small>Thank you for your attention to this matter and I look forward to
hearing  from you in the near future. If you have any questions, please feel
free to contact me.</small></p>
