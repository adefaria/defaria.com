     <br>
     I, Andrew DeFaria, do hereby declare under penalty of perjury that the 
 following   is true and correct:<br>
     <br>
     I married my wife, Olga A. DeFaria. While at first we had some hard
times,    our relationship has developed into good marriage. Together, we
are helping    to raise my 10 year old United States citizen daughter from
a previous  marriage.<br>
     <br>
     My wife came to the United States from the Ukraine. Her father was an 
 alcoholic.   Olga's father was very abusive. He often attacked Olga's mother, 
 sometimes with an ax. Her troubled father ended up committing suicide which 
 Olga had  witnessed. Her childhood was one of fear and depression<a
 href="#1"><sup>1</sup></a>.  She ran away from home and was the victim of 
 sexual abuse. She returned home  and was sexually abused again. She is now 
 a recovering alcoholic and under  medical and psychological care<a
 href="#2"><sup>2</sup></a>. She is currently  completing an Intensive Outpatient 
 program<a href="#3"><sup>3</sup></a>.  Together we are seeking therapy and 
 treatment<a href="#4"><sup>4</sup></a>.   <br>
     <br>
     I love my wife very much. I am aware of her criminal history because
I  helped   her in her criminal defense. I am aware of her medical problems, 
 recovering   alcoholic, depression, and suicidal attempts. Some people may 
 wonder why I  stay with her notwithstanding of all that has happened, the 
 answer is clear   - I stay because I love her and I am willing to work with 
 her for her sake.<br>
     <br>
     If my wife is not admitted and given legal residence and the waiver
herein    requested denied, I, a United States citizen, would suffer extreme
hardships.    In addition, my daughter, Olga's step daughter, is also becoming
bonded  and   very attached. Each of us would suffer individually and we
would suffer  cumulatively   if Olga was not granted a waiver.<br>
     <br>
     The hardships we would suffer are as follows:<br>
       
<h3>1 Emotional Hardship</h3>
       
<h4>1a. Emotional hardship caused by separation</h4>
     If a waiver is not granted there will be a separation of my wife from 
 me.   All of my family and my daughter lives in the United States. I have 
 lived  here all my life. I have work here. Our daughter has her school,
her  friends  and her life here.<br>
     <br>
     In the Ukraine<a href="#5"><sup>5</sup></a> there is no work. There
is  a  dangerous level of crime. The economy is in shambles. There is no
work  for  a person with my skills. The political situation is unstable.
Foreigners    are not liked and not easily accepted into society. People
live in fear  of  their lives from crime and poverty. There is little hope
for anyone in  Ukraine.  I do not speak Russian. I would have to leave our
daughter in the  United  States since the custody order does not allow our
daughter to leave  the country  without a new order. My ex wife has legal
custody of my daughter  and would  not allow me to take her to the Ukraine.
Life in the Ukraine would  not be  an option for me nor our daughter.<br>
     <br>
     Therefore, I could not go to live with my wife in the Ukraine. Furthermore, 
   our daughter would not be allowed to join us in the Ukraine. If no waiver 
   is granted our family will be forcefully separated.<br>
     <br>
     Our family has suffered much already but together we have managed to
be    strong. To have suffered so much already and to be forcefully separated 
 because  of no waiver would be an incredible blow to our family.<br>
     <br>
     On being separated the psychological pain would be great. My wife and 
 I  will miss the enriching bonding that a close family has to offer. I will
   be hurt and miss my wife. Our daughter will be hurt and miss her step
mother.    Both the psychological pain and loss of bonding would create an
extreme  hardship.<br>
     <br>
     If we were separated I would only be able to call and occasionally visit 
   my wife in the Ukraine. However the expense of international calls and 
 international   travel would require that this contact would be extremely 
 limited. And my   ex wife would be very reluctant to allow our daughter
to  even visit her step   mom in the Ukraine, if she would allow it at all.
The  separation would be   an extreme hardship, being away from my wife that
I  love dearly would be  very hard.<br>
       
<h4>1b. Separation of our daughter from her step-mother </h4>
     For the factual reasons noted above, our daughter would also have to
stay    in the United States. If her step-mother had to depart, the separation 
 would   be an extreme hardship. There is a psychological bonding and security 
 as well  as a growing love between them. If separated, our daughter would 
 not only  suffer greatly but it will have a devastating impact on her for 
 the rest  of her life. The result would be that my daughter and wife would 
 suffer greatly.<br>
       
<h4>1c. Cumulative effect of the separation</h4>
     With the separation of my wife from our family I would suffer and my
daughter    will suffer as noted above, but furthermore I would suffer additionally 
 at  seeing our daughter suffering at being separated from Olga. And our
daughter    would suffer at seeing me suffer because of the separation between
Olga  and  I. There would be great suffering from all three of us which would
make  each  of us suffer more.<br>
       
<h3>Economic Hardship</h3>
       
<h4>2a Economic hardship to me</h4>
     If a waiver is not granted I would suffer great economic hardship. If 
 my   wife is in the Ukraine I would have to support her there. As noted
above  the  economy is bad and my wife would be unable to support herself.
Also  as noted  above, my wife has special medical and psychological needs.
I would  have  to send her the funds to pay for very expensive treatments
in the Ukraine.    The expense of providing a second household and medical
care would be extremely    high. I do not know how I would be able to provide
her with the funds she    needs.<br>
     <br>
     In the year 2000 I made over $180,000.00 but in 2001 I only made $64,774. 
   This year my taxable income is $31,035. This economic downturn has effected 
   my profession very much.<br>
     <br>
     While I am not poor, I am managing to get by with this bad U.S. economy. 
   I would be hard pressed to provide Olga with the funds she would need.<br>
       
<h4>2b. Economic hardship to our daughter<br>
     </h4>
     If a waiver is not granted our daughter would suffer extremely. Not
only    would the household suffer as noted above, but the reduction of funds
in    my household would be felt by our daughter. No longer would I be able
to    provide the small things which the children need, like money for sports,
   family outings and our daughter's own small desires.<br>
     <br>
     Our daughter now has a happy and comfortable life which would change
and    then would become one of grim and strict budgeting and doing without
in  order   for me to support my wife living in another country and provide
for  her medical  and psychological treatments.<br>
    <br>
    If I were to consider moving to the Ukraine and separating from our daughter,
   even if I managed to find a job in the Ukraine, I do not know how I would
   be able to pay my court mandated child support of approximately $1000/month
   as I do not think that I would be able to obtain employment in the Ukraine
   for even that much of a monthly salary, never mind make money above that
   figure to be able to afford to pay for the medical attention my wife would
   need and to be able to survive in the Ukraine. Not being able to pay my 
 child  support would be an extreme hardship on our daughter and on my ex 
 wife and  her family as they use that money to provide for our daughter. 
 Lack of these  funds would additionally throw another family of United States 
 citizens into  financial turmoil. Again, my moving to the Ukraine is not 
 a very viable option  for me.<br>
     <br>
     The economic hardship to the household finances would cause us to suffer 
   as noted herein a very extreme hardship.<br>
       
<h4>2c. Cumulative effect of economic hardship</h4>
     Lastly, and not to be overlooked, is that with the change in our household's 
   economic situation, there would be other hardships. I would suffer at
knowing    I could not give our daughter all that I have given her in the
past. There    would be an extreme feeling of guilt. My daughter may even
develop resentment    toward Olga and even myself because of what the drain
of resources would    do to our former way of life. This too would be an
extreme hardship.<br>
       
<h3>3 Psychological Hardship</h3>
       
<h4>3a. Psychological hardship on me</h4>
     If a waiver is not granted I would suffer psychologically, different
from    emotional harm, the psychological harm of being away from the one
you love.    The psychological harm in the worry of not knowing how your
spouse is doing    day in and day out. The worry that the economy is poor
and my wife would  not  have a place to live or work. With the previous problems
she has had  home  she clearly would be unable to return to her parent's
home.<br>
     <br>
     My wife's medical and psychological needs are being covered here in
the    United States through my Kaiser coverage. In the Ukraine this type
of care    may exist but would be out of our reach economically. The treatment
my wife    now has is making all the difference in the world from keeping
her from  being  depressed, sober and non suicidal. Without this treatment
living in  the Ukraine  would be devastating to my wife's progress. Furthermore,
returning  to the  Ukraine would be returning to the environment which created
all the  medical  and psychological problems which she developed. Clearly
this is  of great  harm. With me knowing this I would get very depressed
thinking  of these possibilities.  I would be very worried that such an environment 
 and separation from her  loving husband and family, faced with the same
environment  in which her previous  sexual attackers still reside and without
proper medical  and psychological  attention she needs, that she would become
extremely depressed  and suicidal  again. In fact, I have been seeking psychological
consultation  and medication  myself trying to cope with the possibility
of this waiver  being denied and  having my family broken up as described
herein.<br>
       
<h4>3b Psychological hardship on our daughter<br>
     </h4>
     If a waiver is not granted there would be great psychological harm to 
 our  daughter. Not only would the psychological harm parallel the emotional 
 harm,   but our daughter would be emotionally traumatized if she were to 
 be separated   from someone with whom she is developing such a good and
deep  loving relationship.   The psychological harm will be great and certainly 
 reach the level of extreme   hardship to my daughter.<br>
       
<h4>3c. Cumulative effect of psychological hardship</h4>
     If a wavier is not granted and I see our daughter suffer as described 
 above   I would be further harmed psychologically. My daughter would also 
 suffer psychologically  at seeing me suffer psychologically. The cumulative 
 effect of the psychological  hardship would create an additional extreme 
 hardship to me and my daughter  alike.<br>
       
<h3>Other Hardships</h3>
       
<ol>
       <li>Loss of opportunities. My wife's health is improving, she is so 
 much   better. She is at the point in her recovery that she is now looking 
 for employment.   With her employment she will become a stronger person
and  be able to contribute   to our family's economy. Therefore, if she was
forced  to leave there would  be a loss of these opportunities to our household. 
 We would lose a stronger  wife/mother and lose her economic support.</li>
       <li>The whole experience I have suffered with my wife and her problems 
   have left an injury in me psychologically. I am on medication, Wellbutren, 
   for my depression. My depression all stems from the possibility of losing
   my wife and the destruction of my family. If my wife were to leave I know
   I would suffer additional depression as the fears that are driving my
depression    become a reality. I am uncertain as to the level of harm I
would suffer,    but it is foreseeable that I would need more medication
and therapy.</li>
       <li>My fear for her safety. I am scared for my wife's safety. I fear 
 she   will face so many problems, as noted above, that she may become suicidal 
 again.  I fear because of the level of crime in her country. I fear for
the  very  real possibility of her coming into contact with the same persons
that  previously  attacked her. I do not think that she could be safe in
any way.</li>
       
</ol>
     In summary, if my wife were denied this waiver:<br>
<ol>
  <li>I would suffer extreme hardship due to forced separation from my wife</li>
  <li>Joining my wife in the Ukraine would not be a viable option because
I do not speak Russian, the ability to obtain employment is very limited
in my field and I could not afford to support my wife and myself and support
our daughter back in the United States if I were to move to the Ukraine.</li>
  <li>I would be forced to choose between a relationship with my wife and
a relationship with our daughter.</li>
  <li>It would be very difficult to have more children, a primary goal for
both of us when we decided to marry, in an international, long distance relationship.<br>
  </li>
  <li>If I were to choose our daughter then contact and communication with
my wife would be severely limited due to expense and logistics.</li>
  <li>Our daughter would suffer emotionally and psychologically due to the
breaking of the bond between her and her step-mother.</li>
  <li>Forced separation would have a cumulative effect on the emotional suffering
of our daughter and I.<br>
  </li>
  <li>It would be an extreme hardship on me financially to attempt to afford
a second household to support my wife, with her additional medical and treatment
needs, in the Ukraine and our daughter in the US.</li>
  <li>Our daughter would suffer economically as a forced separation would
drastically increase the financial load on our family.</li>
  <li>I would worry greatly about the lack of treatment that my wife would
be able to get in the Ukraine, that she might come into contact with the
very people and situations that have caused her so much psychological harm
before. It is a very real possibility that she might become suicidal again.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>I would suffer additional psychological problems and need even more
treatment than I have already sought due to my worry of separation from my
wife and the possibility of her becoming suicidal again.</li>
  <li>Our family would lose a strong wife and mother and economic opportunities
that she brings to the family.</li>
  <li>I would fear for my wife's safety in the Ukraine and I would not be
able to protect and provide for her adequately.<br>
  </li>
</ol>
As a family we are doing well in all respects. As a family  we   have a stable
and secure home. If my wife were denied the waiver then  I would   be forced
into a terrible choice: To be permanently separated from  my wife   since
there would be no other way for her to immigrate, or to join  her in   such
a dire, bleak life as described above and be permanently separated  from
  our daughter and causing further harm to our daughter and disruption  of
her  financial well being not to mention being unable to fulfill my financial
   and court ordered obligation to provide financial support for our daughter.
   In both options our daughter and I would suffer greatly, emotionally,
economically,    psychologically and physically. The end result of the waiver
not being  granted   would be to destroy a happy home and cause a loss of
love, bonding  and security.   If the waiver is not granted it would condemn
me to poverty  and a life of   no hope as a separated family.<br>
