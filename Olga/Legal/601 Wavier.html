Dear James Lopez,<br>
  <br>
 
<div align="center"> 
<div align="left">I have enclosed a as much as I have at this time from your
list of things that you need to process my wife's 601 waiver. I am still
waiting for a few things like a copy of the title for my house.<br>
 <br>
I realize that I need to prove that I, and my daughter, would experience
extreme hardship if Olga is removed. Here are some of the thoughts that I
have that may help the immigration court to see that such a hardship would
be extreme to me:<br>
 
<ul>
   <li>I would be separated from my wife.</li>
   <li>My career, 25 years in the field of computers, is not that developed 
in the Ukraine, thus it would be extremely difficult for me to obtain work 
in my profession.</li>
   <li>If I move to the Ukraine to be with my wife I would be separated from 
my ten year old daughter from a previous marriage as I do not have legal custody
of her and her mother would never allow my daughter to travel to the Ukraine.
Also note that my father had left me when I was ten years old, not to be
found again for 18 years, and I promised myself that I would never desert
my daughter.</li>
   <li>I do not speak Russian</li>
   <li>I own a 4 bedroom house, for which I paid handsomely at the height 
of the housing market, and would lose a lot of money being forced to sell 
it.</li>
   <li>The average salary in the Ukraine is around 150 US$/month. Even if 
I would manage to find a job at say $200/month there I would be nowhere need 
the ~$1000/month I am required to pay as child support.</li>
   <li>If I move to the Ukraine I would also have the additional burden of 
getting adequate medical and&nbsp;psychiatric  help for Olga as her problems 
would persist.<br>
   </li>
   <li>I fear for my wife's safety should she be removed and I only travel 
to Ukraine when I can to visit her. She has been suicidal in the past (see 
Kaiser records) and she lacks adequate support from her family (also in the 
Kaiser records).&nbsp;</li>
  <li>If separated from my wife I know that I would again experience severe
mental depression. While my wife was in jail and facing possible deportation
and INS detainment I had attended a crisis group at Kaiser as well as went
on Prosaic and sought the help of mental health professionals.<br>
  </li>
 
</ul>
  <br>
  Sincerely<br>
     <br>
     <br>
