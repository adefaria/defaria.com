Dear Mr. Speare,<br>
<br>
The following is a statement which I intend to attempt to enter into the
record on behalf of my wife, Olga. I think it is important the the court
know of the state of Olga's mental condition and her adverse mental conditions.
This statement can be applied to both the domestic violance and the theft
cases. I'm still not sure if they will managed to combine these two incidents
in to one trial.<br>
<br>
I'm not sure if "delayed verdict" or "delayed sentencing" is even allowed
in California but I hope that they are and that we might be able to take
advantage of them.<br>
<br>
Please let me know if this helps you or if you think I should not attempt
to enter this statement. Note that I did not have the time to copy the attachments
but I will do so and sent you this via regular mail if you need it.<br>
<br>
I was also planning on sending this to Olga's public defender. Let me know
if you think that that would be unwise.<br>
<br>
Sincerely<br>
<br>
<br>
Andrew DeFaria<br>
