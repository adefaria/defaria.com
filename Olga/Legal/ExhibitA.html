<h3>Notes</h3>
     
<ul>
     <li>Dr. D. A. Wueste LCSW, who Olga had seen on 10/10/2002, recommended 
 that Olga attend a Crisis Group the following day.</li>
     <li>Olga attended the IOP program on Monday 10/14, Tuesday 10/15, Thursday 
 10/17 and Friday 10/18. I don't know why she didn't go Wednesday 10/16. Perhaps
 she did and I am unable to locate her Kaiser receipt.</li>
   <li>Kaiser's medical records follow. I have highlighted many key points 
including that Olga was seeking help from Kaiser from as early as September
1, 2002 until October 20, 2002. To summerize I find the following troubling 
terms mentioned multiple times: Depression (15 times), Bulimia (14), Suicidal 
Thoughts (11), Alcohol Abuse (7), Eating Problems (5), Acute Stress (5), Suicidal
Attempts (4), Implusive Behavior (4), Anxious Feelings (3), Antidepressent 
Paxil (3), Worry (2), Hopelessness (2), Can't Enjoy Things (2), No Menstration 
for 5 years (1), Vomitting (1), Sadness (1), Anger (1), Antisocial Behavior 
(1), Helplessness (1), Guilt (1), Fear (1), Sleep Problems (1), Worthlessness 
(1), Memory Problems (1), Panic Attackes (1). I think it's clear that according 
to the trained mental health professionals at Kaiser, my wife has significant 
psychological problems.<br>
