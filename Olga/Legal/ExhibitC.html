<h3>Notes</h3>
 
<ul>
   <li>I couldn't find receipts for September but that could just be that 
Olga or I had thrown them in the garbage. It seems clear to me that there 
is a pattern of alcohol abuse.&nbsp;</li>
   <li>I do not drink wine very often and I don't recall drinking any of
these wines.&nbsp;</li>
   <li>After Olga was arrested, I did find two large bottles of wine in Olga's 
closet that I emptied in the sink and threw out.<br>
   </li>
