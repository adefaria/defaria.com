Dear Mr. Lopez,<br>
<br>
I have attached a new copy of the 601 Waiver statement. I have made some
changes, cleaned up some of the grammar and added a few things. Please review
this and let me know if there is any additional changes we should make before
submitting this to the INS.<br>
<br>
Note that I attempted to summarize at the end of the document. I'm not sure
if this is a good or a bad idea. Let me know what you think.<br>
<br>
Finally, please contact me when you are ready for me to sign this statement.<br>
<br>
Sincerely<br>
<br>
