Dear Mrs. Harrison,<br>
<br>
My name is Andrew DeFaria and I am engaged to a Ms. Olga Fedoryaka, AKA Olga
Moffat. Attached is a release from her for you to release her records to
me. In or around May of 1996 you represented Olga in a divorce case, DR95-96796,
in Maricopa County Court from a Michael Moffat. I need the records for that
case. In particular I need a copy of the Prenuptual Agreement between Mr.
Moffat and Olga and any information explaining the $10,000.00 settlement
that Olga received from that divorce. I am attempting to bring Olga to the
United States on a K1 Fianc&eacute;e Visa and the US Embassy in Warsaw has
an issue with the money that Olga received for this settlement. I believe
that they think that this money may have been involved in some sort of scheme
to "buy" a "greencard" or a payback for a "purchased" greencard that was
never issued due to the divorce. I do not believe that this was the case
and need evidence to present to the Embassy.<br>
<br>
In any event I need this paperwork or official statement to satisfy the Embassy's
concerns and I need it quickly. I have called your office repeatedly and
often and you have failed to return my calls. Apparently you are on a leave
of absence, however somebody in your office should be able to assist me.
<br>
<br>
Please send me these documents as soon as possible to the address listed
above. I need them before April 26th as I am leaving to go to the Embassy
at that time.<br>
<br>
If you have any questions then do not hesitate to call<br>
