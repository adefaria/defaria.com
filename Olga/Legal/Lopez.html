Dear Mr. Lopez<br>
<br>
A little explaination about how I filed the I-485. I had downloaded the form
from the INS web site and filled it out with my computer. When preparing
the envelop for the INS I looked at the form and found out how much the fees
were. Then I wrote checks for the fees. Now I knew that the INS had raised
the fees a while ago and assumed that they appropriately correspondingly
updated their forms on their web site but they didn't. This, along with a
single page that somehow wasn't included, caused my first attempt at the
I-485 filing to be returned. I've included that notice from the San Jose
INS, dated July 19th. Shortly thereafter, like in about 1 week, I rewrote
the checks for the correct amount and found the missing page (sure wish the
INS would have said something like "recheck your application. Pages appear
to be missing" so I wouldn't have had to figure this out on my own).<br>

I have no receipt for this, not that I didn't try to get one. In fact Olga
and I arrived at the INS office at 4 Am and stayed in line until 7 Am when
we were told that we should drop the application into the mailbox there that
is designated for such things. I said "I knew I could do that but wanted
to deliver it personally so that I could get that receipt to be used as proof
of filing". The INS agent checking the line said that I could go in and talk
to somebody but they will say the same thing. So we dropped the application
into the mailbox. That was my first filing that was returned. As I said,
after that I fixed the application and rewrote the checks then drove by the
INS office and deposited it into the same mailbox.<br>

We did get a letter from the INS for the fingerprint interview and did go
there. I could locate that if you need it. During this interview Olga was
fingerprinted and received a temporary EAD card. Do you need that? Let me
know.<br>

Sincerely<br>
