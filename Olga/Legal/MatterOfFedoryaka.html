<h2>Background</h2>
   Olga Fedoryaka entered the US March of 1995 on a K1 Fianc&eacute; Visa 
with Michael Moffat from Tempe, Arizona. They married on May 27, 1995 within 
the required 90 period. Shortly after marrying Michael Moffat left for Thailand
 for 6 months as part of his job. Olga could not accompany him since she
had  not yet completed the Adjustment of Status process nor had they had
time to complete the Advanced Parol process. By the time Michael returned
6 months  later their marriage was showing signs of difficulties and they
separated  and were divorced by May 3, 1996.   
<p>Olga remained in the US, obtained a job (Michael had helped her obtain 
 a green card) and an apartment. Near the end of 1996 Olga met Jon Miller 
and they dated for a while. They married January 18, 1997 for a very brief 
time. Shortly thereafter Olga felt that she did not love Jon and could not 
see a lifetime of togetherness with him so she filed for divorce. The divorce
 was finalized by July 14, 1997. At no time did Olga file for any INS benefits
 from her marriage to Jon Miller. </p>
   
<p>After divorcing Jon, Michael, Olga's first ex husband, contacted Olga. 
 He was concerned that Olga was overstaying her welcome to the US. He had 
consulted with an immigration lawyer who informed him that due to a change 
in INS laws as of April 1997, Olga had 180 days to leave the US and she would 
be able to later return to the US without penalty. Michael urged Olga to consider
leaving the US and offered to help her go to Hong Kong on a tourist visa.
Olga left the US on September 27, 1997 and stayed with Michael for 3 months
in Hong Kong. When her Hong Kong tourist visa expired she returned to Kiev,
Ukraine. </p>
   
<p>I met Olga in July, 2000. I returned in September, 2000 we got engaged
 and I started the K1 Fianc&eacute; visa process. I visited her again in
December,  2000 and we were approved in January 2001. We had an interview
date of April  23, 2001 in Warsaw. While at the interview the consular questioned
Olga's  exit from the US, requiring us to obtain additional documentation
of her departure from the US and entry from Hong Kong to Kiev, Ukraine. We
provided that documentation.  </p>
   
<p>Next, in explaining the sequence of events in US the supervising consular 
 grew suspicious about Olga's second marriage to Jon Miller. He voiced his 
 concern that the marriage was a sham marriage intended to fraudulently obtain
 immigration benefits and decided to send our application back to the INS
in Vienna for "administrative review".</p>
   
<h2>Charge</h2>
  The consular charges that Ms. Fedoryaka is inelligable for a visa based 
on INA 212(a)(6)(C)(i) which states:<br>
   
<blockquote><span style="font-family: arial; "><span style="font-size: 15px; ">
  In general.-Any alien who, by fraud or  willfully misrepresenting a material
 fact,  seeks to procure (or has sought to procure or  has procured) a visa,
 other documentation, or  admission into the United States or other  benefit
 provided under this Act is  inadmissible.</span></span><br>
    </blockquote>
  He bases this on the record which shows that Ms. Fedoryaka was previously
 in the US and she had two marriages to US citizens of short duration. However
 the record shows no evidence that Ms. Fedoryaka had sought to procure a
visa  or any other benefit of the INA. It is devoid of any application for
any benefit from her second marriage to Mr. Miller. The record shows an application
for Adjustment of Status from her first marriage to Mr. Moffat. It also shows
 a retraction of the invitation for the Adjustment of Status interview by
Mr. Moffat due to the disolution of the marriage. So the consular's decision
to return this petition for administrative review seems to be based merely
on supicion of fraudulent activity.<br>
    <br>
  However looking at 9 FAM 42.43 N2.1 Petitions Approved in Error:<br>
       
  <blockquote>The approval of a petition is usually considered to be prima 
 facie evidence that the alien beneficiary has met the petition requirements. 
 Unless a petition has been approved in error, the petition can only be returned
 if the consular officer knows, or has reason to believe, that the beneficiary
 is not entitled to status. Knowledge and reason to believe must be based
upon evidence that the INS did not have available at the time of adjudication.
 This evidence often arises as a result of or during the consular officer&#8217;s
 interview. <u>Reason to believe must be more than mere conjecture or speculation</u>
  &#8212;there must exist probability, <u>supported by evidence</u> that the alien
 is not entitled to status.</blockquote>
   And 9 FAM 42.43 N2.2 Cases of Sham Marriages:           
    <blockquote>INS has minimum evidentiary standards that must be established 
 before revocation proceedings may begin. These minimum evidentiary standards 
 are:               
      <p>(1) A written statement from one or both of the parties to the marriage 
 or documentary evidence that money exchanged hands; or </p>
               
      <p>(2) <u>Factual evidence developed by the consular officer that would 
 convince a reasonable person that the marriage was a sham marriage entered 
 into to evade immigration laws.</u></p>
        </blockquote>
               
      <h2>Criteria for Finding of Ineligibility</h2>
  Now let's look at the criteria used to find ineligibility. According to 
&nbsp;9 FAM 40.63 N2 Criteria for Finding of Ineligibility:<br>
               
      <blockquote> In order to find an alien ineligible under INA 212(a)(6)(C)(i),
 it must be determined that:<br>
          <br>
  (1) There has been a misrepresentation made by the applicant [see 9 FAM 
40.63 N4 ];<br>
   (2) The misrepresentation was willfully made [see 9 FAM 40.63 N5 ]; and<br>
   (3) The fact misrepresented is material [see 9 FAM 40.63 N6 ], or<br>
   (4) The alien uses fraud [see 9 FAM 40.63 N3 ] to procure a visa or other 
 documentation [see 9 FAM 40.63 N7 ], to receive a benefit under the INA [see
 9 FAM 40.63 N7 ].<br>
          </blockquote>
  I submit that no such misrepresentation was made by Ms. Fedoryaka. Indeed
 our petition disclosed both marriages and included their divorce decrees.
 The petition did not misrepresent nor conceal them. Further Ms. Fedoryaka
 did not use fraud to procure a visa or benefit under the INA with respect
 to her marriage to Mr. Miller, in fact she sought nothing as the record
shows.<br>
          <br>
  Also, accordning to 9 FAM 40.63 N1.2 Not a Substitute for Other INA 212(a)
 Ineligibility "The section was not intended to permit - and must not become
 a device for - entrapment of aliens whom the consular officer might suspect
 to be ineligible on some other ground(s) for which there is not sufficient
 evidence to sustain a finding of ineligibility" and "it must also be borne
 in mind that aliens may not be denied visas simply because they do not seem
 to be particularly desirable individuals as either immigrants or nonimmigrants"
 yet it appears as if the consular returned the approved petition based merely
 on suspicion that Mr. Fedoryaka does not seem to be particularly desirable
 as either an immigrant or nonimmigrant.<br>
          <br>
  And in 9 FAM 40.63 N3 Different Standards for Findings of "Fraud" or "Willfully
 Misrepresenting a Material Fact":                  
        <blockquote>a. The fact that Congress used the terms "fraud" and
"willfully misrepresenting a material fact" in the alternative indicates
an intent to set a lower standard than is required in making a finding of
what is known in the law as representation of a material fact with knowledge
of its falsity and with the intent fraud. The distinction between the two
terms is not readily apparent. For the purposes of this section, <u>the Board
of Immigration Appeals has determined that a finding of "fraud" requires
a determination that the alien made a false </u><u>representation of a material
fact with knowledge of its falsity and with the intent</u><u> to deceive
a consular or immigration officer.<br>
            </u></blockquote>
  Again I submit to you that at no time did Ms. Fedoryaka make a false representation 
with the intent to deceive the consular.<br>
            <br>
  This petition was already approved by the INS and according to &nbsp;9
FAM  40.63 N10.1 Misrepresentation in Family Relationship Petitions "a misrepresentation
 with respect to entitlement to status under a family-relationship petition,
 e.g., document fraud, sham marriage or divorce, etc., cannot be deemed material
 as long as the petition is valid"           
          <h2>Did fraud occur?</h2>
 While not directly applicable to this case the following seems germane (I 
can no longer find the title for this excerpt. The URL I have for this is 
          <a href="http://www.ins.usdoj.gov/cgi-bin/folioisa.dll/fedreg.nfo/query=fraud+marriage/doc/%7B@27968%20%7D/words=4?">

           <a href="http://www.ins.usdoj.gov/cgi-bin/folioisa.dll/fedreg.nfo/query=fraud+marriage/doc/%7B@27968%20%7D/words=4?">
 }/words=4?</a>
  however that no longer works):<br>
           
          <blockquote>A petition must be denied under the provisions of section 
204(c) of the Act if there is substantial and probative evidence that the 
self-petitioner has ever attempted or conspired to enter into a marriage for
the purpose of evading the immigration laws. The self-petitioner does not
need to have received a benefit through the attempt or conspiracy. He or
she also need not have been convicted of, or even prosecuted for, the attempt
or conspiracy. <u>Evidence of the attempt or conspiracy, however, must be
contained in the self-petitioner's immigration file.</u></blockquote>
 yet, even though Ms. Fedoryaka never filed as a self-petitioner, the above 
can be viewed as a requirement for a finding that fraud had or had not occurred. 
The record is void of any evidence of the attempt or conspiracy to commit 
marriage fraud.<br>
            <h2>Is Ms. Fedoryaka Excluable under&nbsp;212(a)(6)(C)(i)?</h2>
According to <b>Interim Decision #3086: Matter of Kahy</b>:<br>
            <blockquote>(2) Where the record contains evidence that a visa
petition was previously filed seeking nonquota status for an alien based
on a fraudulent marriage, the burden then shifts to the petitioner to prove
that the alien did not seek to be accorded nonquota status based on the prior
marriage. Section 204(c)(1) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. &sect; 1154(c)(1) (Supp.
IV 1986).<br>
              </blockquote>
The record does not show that a visa petition was previously filed. Also,
              <br>
              <blockquote>(3) A visa petition may be denied pursuant to section
204(c)(2) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. &sect; 1154(c)(2) (Supp. IV 1986), where there
is evidence in the record to indicate that an alien previously conspired
to enter into a fraudulent marriage.</blockquote>
Again, the record does not show evidence that Ms. Fedoryaka conspired to
enter into a fraudulent marriage.<br>
                <br>
Also:<br>
                <blockquote>It is well established that fraud or willful
misrepresentation of a material fact in the procurement or attempted procurement
of a visa, or other documentation, must be made to an authorized official
of the United States Government in order for excludability under section
212(a)(6)(C)(i) of the Act to be found. See Matter of D-L- &amp; A-M-, 20
I&amp;N Dec. 3162 (BIA 1991); Matter of Shirdel, 19 I&amp;N Dec. 33 (BIA
1984); Matter of L-L-, 9 I&amp;N Dec. 324 (BIA 1961). The record contains
no evidence that the applicant practiced fraud or made a willful misrepresentation 
to a United States Government official in procuring or in seeking to procure 
documentation. Accordingly, we find that the issue at hand is whether the 
applicant is excludable for fraud or willful misrepresentation of a material 
fact in seeking to procure entry into the United States.<br>
                  </blockquote>
The record does not show that Ms. Fedoryaka attempted to fraud or willfully
misrepresent a material fact in the procurement or attempted procurement
of a visa, or other documentation to an authorized official of the United
States Government with respect to her 1997 marriage to Mr. Miller.<br>
                  <blockquote> 
                    <p></p>
                    </blockquote>
             
                    <h2>Proving the marriage bona fide</h2>
 It is very difficult if not impossible to prove a negative. Absent any evidence 
that fraud occurred all we have left is a presumption of intent that Ms. Fedoryaka
was intending to commit marriage fraud. The penality here if this presumption
is taken as fact is a permanent bar of the alien from entry into the US forever.
Such a heavy penality should not be taken lightly and should not be taken
on a presumption or speculation alone. Evidence and facts should support
any finding before such a severe penality is imposed. Fraudulent or sham
marriages determination normally involve an alien that is attempting to procure
a benefit under INA based on a current marriage of perhaps questionable merit
and the alien is charged with the burden of proving the marriage is bona
fide. But this is not the case here. Ms. Fedoryaka is seeking a fianc&eacute;e 
visa. The marriage in question was 4 years ago to another man.<br>
             <br>
 The usual method for proving a bona fide marriage consists of submitting 
evidence of it validity:<br>
             
                    <blockquote>The Service has previously determined that
a variety of evidence may be used to establish a good-faith marriage, and
a self-petitioner should submit the best evidence available. Evidence of
good faith at the time of marriage may include, but is not limited to, proof
that one spouse has been listed as the other's spouse on insurance policies,
property leases,  income tax forms, or bank accounts; and testimony or other
evidence regarding  courtship, wedding ceremony, shared residence and experiences.
Matter of Laureano, 19 I&amp;N Dec. 1 (BIA 1983). Other types of readily
available evidence might include the birth certificates of children born
to the relationship; police, medical, or court documents providing information
about the relationship;  and affidavits of persons with personal knowledge
of the relationship. Self-petitioners who submit affidavits are encouraged
to submit affidavits from more than one person. Other types of evidence may
also be submitted; the Service will consider any relevant credible evidence.</blockquote>
 However Ms. Fedoryaka's marriage was extremely short as she quickly realized 
that the marriage would not last. As such there is little if any of the normal 
records and evidence as required above. However:<br>
               <br>
               
                      <blockquote>The Act does not define a "good-faith"
marriage or provide guidelines for evaluating the bona fides of a marriage;
however, persons applying for immigration benefits based on a marriage are
generally required to establish that they entered into the marriage in good
faith, and a significant body of case law has developed concerning the interpretation 
of this requirement. It has long been held that a marriage that is entered 
into for the primary purpose of circumventing the immigration laws, referred 
to as a fraudulent or sham marriage, cannot be recognized as enabling a spouse 
to obtain immigration benefits. Lutwak v. United States, 344 U.S. 604 (1953) 
and Matter of Phillis, 15 I&amp;N Dec. 385 (BIA 1975). A spousal petition 
will not be denied, however, solely because the spouses are not living together 
and the marriage is no longer viable. Matter of McKee, 17 I&amp;N Dec. 332 
(BIA 1980). <u>The key factor in determining whether a person entered into 
a marriage in good faith is whether he or she intended to establish a life 
together with the spouse at the time of the marriage</u>. The person's conduct 
after marriage is relevant only to the extent that it bears upon his or her 
subjective state of mind at the time of the marriage. <u>Separation from the
other spouse, even shortly after the marriage took place, does not prove, 
by itself, that a marriage was not entered into in good faith</u>. Bark v.
 INS, 511 F.2d 1200 (9th Cir. 1975).</blockquote>
