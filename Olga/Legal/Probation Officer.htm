 Dear Ms. Jones,<br>
 <br>
 I am writing this statement rather than filing the "Victim's Report" as
the Victim's Report form does not adequately fit my needs. That form is oriented 
towards women being battered by their husband and who want to extract some 
form of restitution. This does not fit my situation at all. On the contrary 
I do not seek restitution rather I seek help for my troubled wife. <br>
 <br>
 I've attached a copy of my statement that I plan to submit to the court
prior  to sentencing. Much of this attachment is evidenturary in nature,
medical  reports, receipts of alcohol purchases and records of attending
various Kaiser  programs, etc. The first few pages contain my statement regarding
my wife,  Olga. Please take this statement in consideration for your presentence
report. I apologize for the length of this statement however I feel strongly
that my statement needs to be heard and considered. I thank you for your
attention in this matter.<br>
