 To my darling wife,<br>
<br>
     I got your wonderfule letter. Thanks. I need you in my life. You show
 me  the beauty in love with your words. I wish I could write as lovingly
as you  do. I wish I could draw as good as you so I could show you better
how I feel.  I have to resort to finding images on the Internet and arranging 
 web pages.  It is what I am good at.<img

    &nbsp; My love, Christmas is almost here and I fear we will be apart
for   Christmas and possibly New Years too. We must be strong. We must remember
  that we are very much in love. That we are building a strong family and
that  family is what is important and what the holidays are all about. And
though  we won't be together physically on the holiday we are deep in each
others  minds, hearts and souls. We will celebrate the holidays this year
in our own way and it will not be any less important because we are connected
as a family and that's the true meaning of the holidays. And next year we
will also celebrate the holidays and we will also still be connected - we'll
just get to celebrate them in a different way because we'll be together.<br>
<br>

     I want you to rejoice and enjoy the hoidays this year even though you
 will  not be with me - you will be in my heart and thoughts always. You
are  going  through big changes, and with the new year there will be a new
you,  free from the shackles of your past, maybe for the first time in your
life.  It might be scary and new to you but realize that you have somebody
very near and dear to you and that is me! I will be your rock, a person you
can always count on, a person you can confide in, somebody you can rely on
to always listen to you, try to understand and have your best interests in
mind. Somebody always willing to help you, comfort you, protect you and make
you happy because I am very much in love with you.<br>
<br>
     And while we are apart this holiday let us remember what we had, for 
in  this bit world we have managed to find each other, two people who fit 
so well together, who have faced hardships before and have managed to overcome
 them. I've said before that we should always keep in mind that deep down
there is a very strong bond of love between us. This has helped us get through 
  some very difficult times before where most others would have given up, 
and  it will help us again.<br>
<br>
     You said that you forgive me for all that I have done to you and that
 I  should forgive you for all that you've done to me. I<img

     do. What has happened here, all the bad things and the finding out of
 your  problems and how they effect you, has helped me a lot to understand
 why things  happened the way they did. With this new understanding I am
positive  we can  overcome all of these things, that you will be much more
happy, I  will be  much more happy and we will have many more of the good
times and  very much  less of the bad times. Knowing what I do now only makes
me closer  to you and I can be much more understanding of you. And I like
what I see!  I see that that beautiful, caring girl that I would only see
once in a while  is indeed alive and real - she wants to come out and play
but she needs to  feel safe. And I know I can make her feel safe. So I know
she will come out  and play more often!<br>

     But love, let us also realize that this will not be without difficulties 
  too. There will be times when things will not be good. We should anticipate 
  and prepare for this. One thing tha twhill help is to remember how much 
we  care for each other. Another is to communicate truthfully and honestly. 
Finally,  and perhaps the most imporant, is to listen and think.<br>
<br>
    &nbsp;So a Merry Christmas to you my love. You are in my heart and mind,
  as always, but even more right now. Be well. Be strong. Try to enjoy yourself.
  Think happy thoughts and realize that I love your very much and that...<br>
