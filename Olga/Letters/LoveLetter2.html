<b><i><font face="Freehand591 BT"><font color="#FF0080"><font size=+2>My
love,</font></font></font></i></b><b><i><font face="Freehand591 BT"><font color="#FF0080"><font size=+2></font></font></font></i></b>
<p><b><i><font face="Freehand591 BT"><font color="#FF0080"><font size=+2>Well
I am writing you this on 13 July 2001, our anniversary. And what a year
it has been! We have been through so much this year, our meeting and time
in Kiev in July, September and for the holidays. We have had a few arguments
and have managed to overcome them. We have even managed to get through
your infidelity to me, something that normally causes a relationship to
fail. I will not lie to you, it was a very difficult time for me. Quite
a few times I thought that I should just give up on you and</font></font></font></i></b>
<br><b><i><font face="Freehand591 BT"><font color="#FF0080"><font size=+2>our
relationship during that time. But something kept bringing me back to you.
I just could not believe that you were a cold and uncaring woman and that
you did not have feelings for me.</font></font></font></i></b><b><i><font face="Freehand591 BT"><font color="#FF0080"><font size=+2></font></font></font></i></b>
<p><b><i><font face="Freehand591 BT"><font color="#FF0080"><font size=+2>Then
in Warsaw we became even closer. And even though we had to struggle with
all of the problems from Warsaw we still managed to make the best of our
time together. In Warsaw we got a taste of what it might be like to be
together in a land that is a little more free than the Ukraine. I was surprised
that we did not argue more given all the pressure we were under. I was
devastated as I realized that I would not be bringing you home with me
and that I had to send you back to your mother's. At times I was completely
weak and you were my strength. Sometimes you were weak and I tried to comfort
you. This was good because it shows that we work well together and that
we both care about each other.</font></font></font></i></b><b><i><font face="Freehand591 BT"><font color="#FF0080"><font size=+2></font></font></font></i></b>
<p><b><i><font face="Freehand591 BT"><font color="#FF0080"><font size=+2>Now
we wait for what seems like forever for the INS to process our paperwork.
We must remain strong and determined and I must continue to push them to
answer us and to fight them to get you here. You must remain strong at
your mothers and not lose hope. I hate the fact that my government is taking
so long to process this and that illegal aliens here in the US are being
processed before us. I hate the days and nights that I am without you.
I think about you all the time. Sometimes this hurts me because I miss
you and want you to be here, to experience and share with me our lives
together.</font></font></font></i></b><b><i><font face="Freehand591 BT"><font color="#FF0080"><font size=+2></font></font></font></i></b>
<p><b><i><font face="Freehand591 BT"><font color="#FF0080"><font size=+2>I
have been waiting for so long, even before I had met you, to be with a
woman would would love me and give my life a sense of purpose. And then
we met and I knew that you were that woman for me. Then I had all of my
hopes, dreams and efforts blow up in my face in February. Slowly I pulled
myself out of this and we patched up our relationship.</font></font></font></i></b><b><i><font face="Freehand591 BT"><font color="#FF0080"><font size=+2></font></font></font></i></b>
<p><b><i><font face="Freehand591 BT"><font color="#FF0080"><font size=+2>From
then until April we strengthened our relationship and got very excited
about the interview and you getting over here. We started planning what
we would do together and how exciting it would be. I dreamed of us returning
to our house and being together for the first time and having the champaign
I bought. I fantasized about waking up in the morning with you by my side.
Then we would pack up some stuff and head out to have breakfast and over
the mountains to the beach. I had planned on having a picnic on the beach
and perhaps heading down to Santa Cruz or Capitola to do some shopping
for you. I envisioned returning back home and your head would be spinning
from all of the fun and excitement of our day together. I wanted to make
you the happiest person in the world and make that day the happiest day
of your life because it would have been the happiest day in my life and
one that I would always treasure and remember.</font></font></font></i></b><b><i><font face="Freehand591 BT"><font color="#FF0080"><font size=+2></font></font></font></i></b>
<p><b><i><font face="Freehand591 BT"><font color="#FF0080"><font size=+2>Also
during February until just recently my life had taken a turn for the worse
in another way. As you know I lost my job in February and did not find
one until June. You do not understand that the US economy has been booming
for most of the 90's and my profession was in real high demand. Life was
good for a long time. And at the beginning of this year all of that changed.
The US economy has taken a turn for the worse and things do not look good.
You do not understand how much this effects me, when I cannot work and
provide for the people that I care about. To me that's a big part of me.
And I had everything going so good in January! I had just gotten my first
house, a nice house, close to my daughter's school and all ready for a
woman to enter my life and make my house, home and life complete. I was
making real good money. And after years searching for a companion, I had
found the perfect one in you! Everything was coming together. Our petition
was just approved and soon you would be here. Even though a year or two
before, after years of searching for somebody to share my life with, saving
to improve my home life and provide a home for my daughter, getting divorced,
having my band fall apart and seeing my music fall apart, I seemed to have
put that all back together again and was accomplishing all of the goals
that were important to me. Who would have thought that in a few weeks everything
I had put together would fall into ruin?</font></font></font></i></b><b><i><font face="Freehand591 BT"><font color="#FF0080"><font size=+2></font></font></font></i></b>
<p><b><i><font face="Freehand591 BT"><font color="#FF0080"><font size=+2>On
that fateful day, 5 Feb, I received the call from Neil that shattered my
very existence. Of course I was in shock and I could not believe it. I
had to hear it from you and to my utter terror I found out it was true!
Not only did I not have a job and faced an incredibly difficult job market,
I just had my heart ripped from my chest. This two major catastrophes haunted
me for months and they were too much for me to bear alone. Luckily at times
like this one often finds that he does have a few people in his life that
care about them. Mary-Anne was great in helping me as was her mother. I
also had help from some people at HP, Kevin, Mary and a few others. People
would shake their heads in disbelief as they learned of all the terrible
misfortunes that crashed down at me at once. But slowly we managed to patch
up our relationship and that gave me hope that maybe I could keep you.</font></font></font></i></b><b><i><font face="Freehand591 BT"><font color="#FF0080"><font size=+2></font></font></font></i></b>
<p><b><i><font face="Freehand591 BT"><font color="#FF0080"><font size=+2>Then
I managed to get our interview rescheduled and once again we both had hope.
But things crashed down on me again in Warsaw and I returned to the US
without you - I left my heart with you again and once again my two major
problems still weighed heavily on my heart and mind. The job market was
no better and now the threat of losing my house grew bigger and bigger.
Once again everything I've been building on was crumbling down again!</font></font></font></i></b><b><i><font face="Freehand591 BT"><font color="#FF0080"><font size=+2></font></font></font></i></b>
<p><b><i><font face="Freehand591 BT"><font color="#FF0080"><font size=+2>Then
things got even more desperate until I finally got the contract in West
Virginia, a place that I'm sure I did not want to bring you to but what
else could I do? I felt totally out of control of my life. Nothing I would
do would ever work the way I wanted it to. All the other forces and people
in the world were controlling me like a puppet and I was powerless and
helpless. But I decided again to continue to fight in any way that I could
to make the dreams that I've had all along become true. Then the last minute
job at United and the hassle to move back into my house and stay here.</font></font></font></i></b><b><i><font face="Freehand591 BT"><font color="#FF0080"><font size=+2></font></font></font></i></b>
<p><b><i><font face="Freehand591 BT"><font color="#FF0080"><font size=+2>And
things are still not looking 100% good. This contract could end soon and
I'll be back where I was before. And who knows how long the INS will take.
But I will continue to fight for myself and to fight for you to be here
with me. We belong together and we need to convince everybody else that
we do indeed belong together. We both know and envision what our lives
together will be like and we both want that life together. We will get
there someday.</font></font></font></i></b>
