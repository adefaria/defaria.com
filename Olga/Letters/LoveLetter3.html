wife,<br>
 <br>
 Do you know how much I love you? I hope you can see in my actions how much 
I love you but I think you need to hear it in words.<br>
 <br>
 You are 100% the kind of woman I've ever dreamed of. Your beauty is exactly 
the kind of beauty I've always loved. I knew that from the first time I saw 
you. After our first date I thought you might not be interested in me and 
it made me sad. After our second date when I realized we both forgot about 
money for the taxi and that you might &nbsp;actually be interested in me
I felt I died and went to heaven! I could hardly sleep that night because
of my excitement. I remember talking to John (Elena's husband in Los Gatos)
and thinking I was a fool for not asking you to marry me before leaving Kiev. 
When I returned to the US I just had to show you how interested I was. I remember
talking to Kevin, asking advice to make sure I wasn't going to fast with
you<br>
 <br>
 Talking on the the phone with you for the next year and a half helped me 
to grow closer to you. Even the incident with Neil taught me that you had 
strong feelings for me. Our problems with the INS showed me that you are as
strong and determined as I am.<br>
 <br>
 When I finally got you here in May I was filled with joy and yet concerned 
about us. I am sorry dear but I just assumed that you would adjust quickly 
and nicely to life in the US with me. I was confused that we did not simply 
have a great time and I was confused why we were often fighting. I feel really 
bad that I could not see through this and recognize the problems you were 
facing. Please forgive me.<br>
 <br>
 And still we've had some wonderful times. I could see that absolutely wonderful 
woman that I have seen and continue to see in you, coming out and sharing 
her beauty and goodness with me. Life was so good when we would laugh and 
have fun together and as a family.<br>
 <br>
 Since I met you have not really thought of another woman who I would want 
to be with. Sure I see other women who are beautiful but now I look at them 
and think "Yeah I have a very beautiful woman of my own". I can appreciate 
the beauty of another women without wanting her. Instead it only makes me 
want you more. As you have said to me I say to you: You are the only one for
me.<br>
 <br>
 You are not only very beautiful to me and very sexy, but I also see a kind, 
gentle woman, yet determined and strong, somebody who knows what she wants, 
somebody who can envision and create great beauty and order in her life and 
in the lives of other people who are important to her. I see a woman generally 
considerate towards her loved ones, a potentially great mother and wife, somebody
who can bring great beauty and love into my life, somebody that I wish to
be close to for the rest of my life. We've had times where I've seen such
beautiful and playful smiles from you that just melt my heart. When we play
together it is just wonderful. I love when I take you somewhere wonderful
and just watch the amazement and joy in your eyes. I love, just love, making
you happy. Perhaps more than making love to you (though that does tend to
make you happy! <img src="/icons/Smiley.gif" alt=""
 width="19" height="19" align="middle">
 )<br>
 <br>
 And you have a very positive effect on my, you make me a better man in hundreds 
of ways. When your in my life I have reason to be a better man, to be cleaner, 
nicer to people, kinder, to take care of myself so that I am the best I can 
be for you. I need you in my life or else my life is just not as important. 
I live for you. You are my sunshine, my sunny day, the difference between 
a wonderfully sunny day and a gray cloudy day. Without you I am a cat without 
a mouse to chase </font></big></big><big><big><font

      </font></big></big><big><big><font face="Monotype Corsiva"> - a fat,
lazy cat with no reason to live. You lit up my life and give me hope that
life is beautiful and and that life makes sense. You complete me perfectly
and nobody else could complete me as perfectly. You are, quite simply, the
love of my life. I need you in my life.<br>
 <br>
 I hope you can now realize how important you are to me, how deeply my feelings 
are for you. You are a very special person to me and to everybody around. 
You have so much to give the world, and I can only hope to be close to you 
so as to feel some of the wonderfulness that the world will feel as you blossom.
I want to be close to the sunlight that you will shine on the world as you
grow. This is what I want.<br>
 <br>
 I loved you in Kiev, in Warsaw, in Chicago, San Francisco, San Jose, at
the beach, in Napa, Tahoe and everywhere. And I will always love you.<br>
 <br>
 Your loving husband</font></big></big><br>
