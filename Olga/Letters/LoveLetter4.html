 You were right when you said that through all the problems our love has
only grown stronger. I love you now more than ever. Our separation now is
making me long for you even more. I miss you dearly. I miss your presence
in my life. I miss your scent. I can take your perfumes and spray them and
smell them but it is not as good as you wearing the perfume. Your essence
is on my mind.<br>
       <br>
 You brought not only order and cleanliness into my life but beauty. I have 
been keeping the house clean but it's a manly clean and as such is blah or 
empty looking. When you're in my life the house doesn't look empty even if 
you are not there. I hope you understand what I'm trying to say.<br>

&nbsp; Love, I can feel your warmth coming through sometimes. I realize you
were not always able to show me your warmth because you were busy handling
your own problems. But recently it has shown itself. For example, when I
was going to China I was touched by your motherly concern for my well being,
how was I packed? Did I bring what I needed for the trip? It's a motherly
type of concern and also a womanly type of &nbsp;concern that a woman has
for her man and her family - a nesting instinct. And more recently how you
became strong and protective of me when they would not let me come and see
you. When you called me that night I was frightened, angry (at them), scared
- a wreck. You calmed me down and comforted me. I thank you for that and
also that display of femininity causes me to be closer to you and love you
more.<br>
       <br>
 But this should not surprise me as you were also my rock, my strength back 
in Warsaw 2001 when again I was a wreck and you were the strong one.<br>
       <br>
 My love we will be together again soon and our time together will be wonderful. 
Oh sure, there will also be hard times and there will be a lot of work ahead. 
But we will have each other and we will work together to face any challenges 
and we will succeed. <br>
       <br>
 Nothing will test our love again as our love has been tested 3 times before. 
We passed those tests and we will pass this one. Most couples would not have 
continued after the first test. Those who did pass it would not have continued 
through the second challenge. And the few that would have waited that long 
year would have called t quits during this challenge. <br>
       <br>
 But I'm still here and your still here and we both have much more love for 
each other and much more understanding of each other than ever before. We 
have to be together!<br>
       <br>
 And you showed me your love in many little ways that I'd like to acknowledge. 
Even if we fought you would still make me lunch and dinner. You always kept 
the house clean. You always kept yourself beautiful. You would say that you 
do it for yourself but I know you also do it for me.<br>
       <br>
 I've told you before that you are the best kisser in the world! Tender yet 
passionate. I don't remember ever having sex with you! All I remember is making
love because honey it's never been just sex with you, I've always felt love
for you and from you. Making love with you is special and cherished by me.
I also love things like a smile, a wink, a playful grin, a tease, some laughter,
screams of passion or gentle kisses afterward. It could be a kis.. kis..
kis.. on the phone or a giggle of a woman who has just soaked her man with
water - it's all good to me and I don't want it to stop ever. The act of
making love is the celebration of the love that two people share with each
other. My mother told me once that sex is sex but making love is beautiful
if it's done with the right feelings.<br>
       <br>
 I miss you darling, miss you every day. I think about you all off the time 
and I want to be with you again real soon. I want to spend a lot of time with
you to show you how much I care for you. I guess I am feeling really sorry
that I did not read your cries for help nor understand what you were going
through. I want to help you through this time of great change because I believe,
no, I know, love and have seen this beautiful woman, not only her external
beauty but her internal beauty. I realize the incredible strength that she
has because she has used it to carry her burdens for many years and I want
to lift and eliminate these burdens from her. I am honored that she has chosen
me to confide in. I am honored that she has chosen me as the man she wants
in her life. And I will honor that choice the best I can. And I will honor
and cherish this woman for the rest of my life.<br>
