<font color="#336666" face="Freehand591 BT" size="5"><b><i>Dear Olga,</i></b></font></p>
<p><font color="#336666" size="5" face="Freehand591 BT"><b><i>Never in a thousand years would I have thought
that I would meet a woman like you! You are so poised with grace and beauty.
You are kind and loving and appreciative. You are intelligent and feminine and interesting. You are a true lady who has a firm grip on my heart.</i></b></font>
<p><font color="#336666" size="5" face="Freehand591 BT"><b><i>I remember back before I came to Kiev for the
first time. It was very exciting for me and my hopes were high that I might
meet the girl of my dreams in the city of my mother's birth. But this is
typical for me. Deep down I am an optimist and I easily believe the best
will happen. But in my life it is not always the case the best does
happen. So I usually look at what may mess that up. I also often attempt
to play down what might be so that I don't get disappointed. Before I came
out to Kiev I remember thinking to myself and planning: What will I do
if this doesn't work for me? For years now I have not be able to find anybody
special where I live. Will I remain alone until I die?</i></b></font>
<p><font color="#336666" size="5" face="Freehand591 BT"><b><i>The time I spent in Kiev was truly wonderful.
I was like a kid in a candy store - there were many beautiful women there
and the all were kind and they all accepted my invitation to go out. You
must understand this just does not happen where I live. If anything it
is the exact opposite here. But quickly I learned that I was still not
making any real connection to any of the women. It is hard to really get
to know somebody in just a few days. And, along with being feminine, the
women are a lot more reserved about themselves and do not open up to somebody
else that quickly. But I was having a great time so I did not think of
my trip as a total loss. If I came home with no perspective wives at least
I had a good time.</i></b></font>
<p><font color="#336666" size="5" face="Freehand591 BT"><b><i>And I remember when I met you at the second social.
I remember seeing you as I was visiting all the tables. I remember coming
back to your table and sitting down next to you. At the time I didn't realize
that that was your table. I remember looking to my left and seeing you
there and I got nervous. But we talked for a while and you were very pleasant
to me, which eased my nervousness. I remember you showing me your photos
and when you showed me the photo of you at your work I didn't know what
to do. It was a very provocative picture and I didn't want you to think
that I was just interested in you for your body. I guess I was embarrassed.</i></b></font>
<p><font color="#336666" size="5" face="Freehand591 BT"><b><i>I believe I came around to your table later and
asked for your number and if you wanted to go out. I needed to work up
the courage to ask you. I'm glad you were still there otherwise we wouldn't
have went out.</i></b></font>
<p><font color="#336666" size="5" face="Freehand591 BT"><b><i>I remember our first date together. I had just
had a date with a nice girl and her son that afternoon. Nothing special.
I got back to the hotel to change for our date. I had made up my mind that
I wanted to take you to the Renaissance, to a fancy place because I considered
you a classy lady. When I came down to the lobby you were late in arriving.
My first fear hit me. Up until then all the ladies were nice and eager
to go out. It was unbelievable to me that I could take out so many beautiful
women. Then you were late. I began thinking that perhaps my luck had run
out, that you were much too good for me and that you wouldn't show up at
all.</i></b></font>
<p><font color="#336666" size="5" face="Freehand591 BT"><b><i>While I was waiting there an
embarrassing thing
happened to me. The lady I had a date with that afternoon arrived at the
hotel dressed to go out. Seems she was going out with one of the other
Americans but he was also late. So here we are, me and her, stuck in the
lobby because our dates were late and we were trying to avoid each other.
Finally I went up to her and said that it was alright, that the men are
doing this and it makes sense that the women are doing it too. Normally
I would have been angry, hurt and crushed if that happened to me but here in Kiev there are
many beautiful women. And I have the most beautiful woman coming here to
meet me for dinner. Eventually you arrived and we went to dinner.</i></b></font>
<p><font color="#336666" size="5" face="Freehand591 BT"><b><i>The restaurant was just fabulous and you looked
great. I remember getting wine, which is something I rarely drink. I remember
telling you not to worry about whatever the evening ended up costing and
that I just wanted to go out to a nice restaurant with a nice lady and have
a good time. I made you promise to not worry about it. I had learned that
Ukrainian women worry about how much money a guy spends on them and I didn't
want that ruining the evening. I remember starring into your eyes as we
talked and that the rest of the restaurant seemed to melt away. But I still
found it difficult to look you directly in the eye for a long time. To
me it was just too intense, too strong a feeling. The atmosphere was very
romantic and I was just getting swept up in the moment. The wine was kicking
in (well at least the portion that I didn't spill on the tablecloth! Talk
about embarrassing!) and my blood was flowing. I was complimenting you often
and I did mean every compliment, but I felt like I was worrying you. I
remember telling you that you were definitely one of the women that I wanted
to see again and to continue to talk to. Turns out you were the only
woman that I said that to.</i></b></font>
<p><font color="#336666" size="5" face="Freehand591 BT"><b><i>The passion and fire that was in my heart at the
restaurant managed to cool itself down a little bit on the taxi ride home.
I started thinking that I messed up the evening by being too intense and
you appeared to be nervous. When we got back to the hotel and said goodnight
I gave you a little kiss and what I remember was that you turned to your
cheek slightly. It all seemed rushed as you were talking to the taxicab
driver. Before I knew it you were off in the taxi. I went back in the hotel
thinking "Well you blew it Andy by going overboard! You'll probably
not see her again because she doesn't seem to be interested in you. Oh well,
you can't win them all". The rest of that night was not particularly pleasant
for me.</i></b></font>
<p><font color="#336666" size="5" face="Freehand591 BT"><b><i>That weekend I had two women come into Kiev that
I was speaking to before through email. One, Svetlana, was staying in my
hotel and the other, Elena, was in another hotel. I had told Svetlana about
Elena and said that I would not be able to see Svetlana very much during
that weekend. Svetlana was staying until Tuesday and Elena was only there
until Sunday. Svetlana said she understood. Turns out that Svetlana was
not at all like I expected her to be. She was too young and immature. The
whole weekend she was trying to cling to me and I was not interested.</i></b></font>
<p><font color="#336666" size="5" face="Freehand591 BT"><b><i>I didn't enjoy the last social on Friday very
much. At this social I had my tux and got some roses to pass out. While
I had fun trying to be Mr. Charming, I did not get a single phone number
at the last social. I didn't see anybody that I liked or was interested
in. There was nobody here to compare to you. I was really hoping to see you there but you didn't show up. I guess
that was good because Svetlana was hanging around me most of the night anyway.</i></b></font>
<p><font color="#336666" size="5" face="Freehand591 BT"><b><i>Elena was also young. I was more interested
in Elena than Svetlana. I spent a good portion of that weekend with Elena
(remember I was still thinking I'd never see you again). But Elena was
elusive and secretive. Then I caught Elena in a lie and I didn't appreciate
that at all. In the end I sent Elena off on a train and told her that I
would not be contacting her anymore.</i></b></font>
<p><font color="#336666" size="5" face="Freehand591 BT"><b><i>At this point it was pretty depressing for me.
All the socials were over and I still didn't have anybody I was seriously
thinking about. And the person I was really interested in, you, was not
interested in me as far as I could tell. Well I still had some more phone
numbers and women I could take out but I felt certain that I would be going
home without knowing that I had somebody that was a good possibility.</i></b></font>
<p><font color="#336666" size="5" face="Freehand591 BT"><b><i>I finally got enough courage to call you again
and see if I could make a better impression on you. I remember thinking
that I need to make a date with you that was more casual and try to take you on
a more sporty date. I thought of horseback riding or bicycling. I tried and tried to find a place for bicycling but I could
not find one. And, as we now know, my lead on the horseback riding was
not all that good.</i></b></font>
<p><font color="#336666" size="5" face="Freehand591 BT"><b><i>That second date started off badly with the weather
not being cooperative. But still we managed alright. And that long taxi
ride out to what was supposed to be a horseback riding place! My heart
sank when I said that we would not be able to ride horses. I kept thinking
she must think I'm a dope! I can't even arrange a date! But again we muddled
through.</i></b></font>
<p><font color="#336666" size="5" face="Freehand591 BT"><b><i>I don't remember when we went up to my hotel room
exactly but I remember that I wanted to show you my pictures and let you
listen to my CD. I remember you listening to the CD. I made sure that I
put on The Reunion because it's a particularly romantic song. You
had the headphones on and was swaying to the music slightly. All I could
do is watch you. Your face looked so lovely as it had your thoughts of
romance on it. I remember leaning down close to your face and I wanted
to kiss you right then and there. But then I remembered that I'd said that
I wouldn't try anything. And here we are alone in my hotel room, you're
sitting on my bed and I'm going to kiss you passionately while you're listening
to a romantic song?!? What will you be thinking? You'll think that I'm
just breaking my promise. I can't do that to you! I respect you and I want
you to like me and be able to trust me when I make a promise to you. Let
me tell you it was a hard thing to maintain control at that moment. Then
you opened your eyes and we both got startled! It was funny and embarrassing but for some reason, by then I felt a little more comfortable about it.</i></b></font>
<p><font size="5" face="Freehand591 BT"><b><i><font color="#336666">I remember we also went to see that movie in Russian.
It's a good thing that I had seen it already in English and that it was
an action film instead of a film with a lot of talking. By this time we
were feeling more comfortable with each other and I felt good about that.
Didn't we also go to that dance club later on? I remember that we started
the date at around 1 in the afternoon and you didn't go back until around
11 or 12 at night. I was beginning to feel much better about you and that
perhaps I was making a good impression on you this time.</font>
<br><br>
<font color="#336666">But, for me, I knew there was something special going
on when we were standing outside of the hotel and kissing. It was like
neither of wanted the night to end. And when you came back into the hotel
because I had forgotten to take care of the taxi all I could think about
was that it was not just me who had lost his mind, thinking not of what
needed to be done but instead thinking of only you. That's when I realized
that you were having the same feelings that I was.</font></i></b></font>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="P1010143.jpg" width="453" height="335">
<p><font color="#336666" size="5" face="Freehand591 BT"><b><i>And our final date was really good too. I decided
not to try to get the bicycles or to search for horseback riding again.
I thought sailing would be better. It was very nice. It was peaceful and
quiet and beautiful. I remember feeling, as we gathered our stuff up in
the boat and got comfortable, that I will do this again with you many times
in America. That walk we had was nice too. At that point we really felt
like a couple to me. It was getting comfortable for me now. I was not as
concerned with looking like a fool, I was interested in looking at you
and learning more about you. And that taxi ride home was wonderful. Gregory
was doing a great job playing those romantic songs and this time I was
not nervous about being romantic.</i></b></font>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="P1010131.jpg" width="501" height="338">
<p><font color="#336666" size="5" face="Freehand591 BT"><b><i>Remember that we tried to find Sean and Elena
to go out dancing? It's funny when you think about what has happened with
them and us now.</i></b></font>
<p><font color="#336666" size="5" face="Freehand591 BT"><b><i>When we were in the dance club later that night
and playing the slot machines I again remember getting a picture of doing
this with you again in America. Maybe Vegas or Reno.</i></b></font>
<p><font color="#336666" size="5" face="Freehand591 BT"><b><i>But when the night was ending I was getting sad.
Not only were you leaving but I was leaving too for America. What was to
happen next? I said that if I met anyone I really felt I had potential
with that I would resist getting engaged right then and that I would instead
talk with them on the phone and in email and come back to see them. Was
that a mistake?</i></b></font>
<p align="left"><font color="#336666" size="5" face="Freehand591 BT"><b><i>Well I sure felt it was a</i></b></font><font size="5" face="Freehand591 BT"><b><i><font color="#336666">
mistake when I was on
that long flight back to the US. A couple of the American guys were talking
about the people they met, and John was already engaged and filing papers. Another
member of the group, Greg, was mesmerized by a lady and was going to get
married. I started thinking "What did I do? I should have Olga fill out
paperwork too!". I couldn't stop thinking about you. I saw your perfume
in the magazine but I wasn't able to get it on the plane because I only
had travelers checks. But I knew that I would get you that perfume. I started
thinking about all the romantic things I could do for you.</font>
<br></i></b>
</font>
<p align="center"><font size="5" face="Freehand591 BT"><b><i>Roses photo here</i></b></font><p align="left"><font size="5" face="Freehand591 BT"><b><i><br>
<font color="#336666">When I got home I immediately order you flowers.
And I started calling you. With every call our love has been growing stronger.
I couldn't wait to get back out to see you. I felt so good when I got the
tickets because I knew that I would definitely be seeing you again.</font>
</i></b>
</font>
<p><font color="#336666" size="5" face="Freehand591 BT"><b><i>As the days went
onward I knew that on my trip back I would ask you to marry me. My first idea of
how to ask you was to go back to the Renaissance and have them make you a cake
that asked you to marry me. I wanted it to say &quot;Da&quot; and &quot;Nyet&quot;
but in the end they just pub &quot;Yes&quot; and &quot;No&quot;. I tried for a
few weeks to get the number of the Renaissance and finally got it. I called them
to arrange the evening but my Russian was not good enough to do that. I emailed
a few AFA interpreters asking them to make the arrangements for me but no one
returned the email. I was getting desperate when I called AFA and asked them for
help. They helped me make arrangements for Wednesday.</i></b></font><p><font color="#336666" size="5" face="Freehand591 BT"><b><i>The
trip out to Kiev in September was long and made even longer by my detainment in
the airport. Not only had I gotten only 2 hours sleep on the 20 hour flight to
Kiev I was forced to sleep on a cold steel bench in the airport that first
night. I was tired cold and frustrated by the security officers and other people
in the airport who would not let me into the country to see you. I could not
page you and I could not reach you at your home either. The frustration broke me
down and I was an emotional wreck.&nbsp;</i></b></font><p><font color="#336666" size="5" face="Freehand591 BT"><b><i>I
had to travel back to Warsaw for my visit and 2 days that I could have spent
with you were wasted. I called you from Warsaw and emotional wreck and crying.
It was like I was a starving man shown a gourmet dinner but not allowed to eat.
Luckily the Ukrainian Embassy processed my visit quickly and I was able to make
the next mornings flight back to Kiev. I said to myself that I would not call
you until I was past customs this time. When I called you I remember your
surprise when I told you I was past customs and you could pick me up. The wait
for you to pick me up was almost unbearable but at least I knew that we would be
able to spend some time together.</i></b></font><p><font color="#336666" size="5" face="Freehand591 BT"><b><i>I
was getting a little angry with you being late but when you arrived all of that
went away. I was so glad to see you finally, so much so I spilled coke all over
you and your purse as we hugged for the first time in a long time. I'm glad you
were able to get that out.&nbsp;</i></b></font><p align="center"><img border="0" src="P9210052.JPG" width="640" height="480"><p><font color="#336666" size="5" face="Freehand591 BT"><b><i>We
settled in to the apartment and all I could think of was that that night was
Wednesday, the night we were supposed to go to the restaurant! But I decided
that it was just too soon to do that now. We spend our first night together and
it was truly wonderful. The next night we were to go to the restaurant. I was
hoping I could make adjustments to my plan for that night. They had put us in
that nice, romantic corner booth and I thought &quot;maybe the restaurant
remembered us and will be all ready for us even though we're a day late&quot;. I
excused myself saying I was using the bathroom to make sure that things were
still on. It's a good thing that I have been taking Russian lessons because they
helped me to talk to the security person who got the waitress for me. They told
me that I was supposed to come last night and I explained my problems at the
airport. It looked like they would not be able to make the cake and I started
thinking of other ways I could make this work. Then the waitress had an idea of
how they could still make the cake and I returned back to the table. I remember
coming into the main room again with a smile on my face. I quickly wiped the
smile off my face so you would not suspect anything just as I came past the
curtain that draped our booth.</i></b></font><p><font color="#336666" size="5" face="Freehand591 BT"><b><i>I
had also thought that you must be thinking that I would ask you to marry me
because we had spoke of our life together in America already on the phone many
times and here I was taking you back to a fancy restaurant, the restaurant of
our first date. So I had a diversionary plan. I had gotten you that necklace to
divert your attention and to satisfy your curiosity should you be thinking that
I was about to propose. It seemed to work nicely.</i></b></font>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="P9210057.JPG" width="640" height="480"></p>
<p><i><b><font color="#336666" size="5" face="Freehand591 BT">When dinner was
done I suggested desert. You said that you weren't hungry and I said that
Ukrainians always have desert! At that time the cake arrived. You were in shock
and didn't know what was going on. I worried because it was a little hard to
read the question that was on the cake. And as is typical your answer did not
immediately come.&nbsp;</font></b></i><p align="center"><img border="0" src="P9210054.JPG" width="640" height="480"><p><i><b><font color="#336666" size="5" face="Freehand591 BT">Of
course I had to ask you the question myself. I was relieved to hear you say yes.
It took you a while to notice the ring on the candle.</font></b></i> <i><b><font color="#336666" size="5" face="Freehand591 BT">And
then we danced cheek to cheek and it was wonderful. When we got back to the
apartment we also danced to &quot;When You Love Somebody&quot; and there was
magic in the air for me.</font></b></i><p align="center"><img border="0" src="P9240088.JPG" width="480" height="640"><p><i><b><font color="#336666" size="5" face="Freehand591 BT">The
rest of our time together was truly wonderful too, with roller blading down
Krushatic, the shopping together, strolling around, making dinner, washing
dishes and taking showers together. I even got to take care of you when you had
a stomach ache. It was only when I was leaving did the anger returned and I said
to myself &quot;If I didn't have that Visa problem getting in I would be able to
spend another two days with her&quot;. We parted at the airport and I remember
how you just disappeared after I went through customs. All I could think about
was to get busy, to get started with the Fiancé Visa paperwork and to get the
house ready. I want to get you here as soon as possible so we can start our life
together.</font></b></i><p><i><b><font color="#336666" size="5" face="Freehand591 BT">And
now I'm coming out again in December. I guess I just can't keep away from you -
and I never want to be away from you for such a long time again. My love we will
be together in December again and we will have another wonderful time. And soon
you will be in my arms in America, in our house, safe, comfortable and happy as
we start our family and life here.</font></b></i>
