Matter of DeFaria</h1></center>

<h2>
Issue</h2>
Olga Fedoryaka entered the US March of 1995 on a K1 Fianc&eacute; Visa
with Michael Moffat from Tempe, Arizona. They married on May 27, 1995 within
the require 90 period. Shortly after marrying Michael Moffat left for Thailand
for 6 months as part of his job. Olga could not accompany him since she
had not yet completed the Adjustment of Status process. By the time Michael
returned 6 months later their marriage was showing signs of difficulties
and they separated and were divorced by May 3, 1996.
<p>Olga remained in the US, obtained a job (Michael had helped her obtain
a green card) and an apartment. Near the end of 1996 Olga met John Miller
and they dated for a while. They married around April of 1997 for a very
brief time. Shortly thereafter Olga felt that she did not love John and
could not see a lifetime of togetherness with him so she filed for divorce.
The divorce was finalized by July 14, 1997. At no time did Olga file for
any INS benefits from her marriage to John Miller.
<p>After divorcing John, Michael, Olga's first ex husband, contacted Olga.
He was concerned that Olga was overstaying her welcome to the US. He had
consulted with an immigration lawyer who informed him that due to a change
in INS laws as of April 1997, Olga had 180 days to leave the US and she
would be able to later return to the US without penalty. Michael urged
Olga to consider leaving the US and offered to help her go to Hong Kong
on a tourist visa. Olga left the US on September 27, 1997 and stayed with
Michael for 3 months in Hong Kong. When her Hong Kong tourist visa expired
she returned to Kiev, Ukraine.
<p>I met Olga in July, 2000. In September, 2000 we got engaged and I started
the K1 Fianc&eacute; visa process. I visited her again in December, 2000
and we were approved in January 2001. We had an interview date of April
23, 2001 in Warsaw. While at the interview the consular questioned Olga's
exit from the US, requiring us to obtain additional documentation of her
departure from the US and entry from Hong Kong to Kiev, Ukraine. We provided
that documentation.
<p>Next, in explaining the sequence of events in US the supervising consular
grew suspicious about Olga's second marriage to John Miller. He voiced
his concern that the marriage was a sham marriage intended to fraudulently
obtain immigration benefits and decided to send our application back to
the INS in Vienna for "administrative review".
<h2>
Questions</h2>

<ul>
<li>
Can it be said that Olga entered into a sham marriage intended to obtain
immigration benefits if she never applied for any immigration benefits?</li>

<li>
Who has the burden of proof for this? Us? Or the INS? (considering that
the potential penalty here is a permanent bar from entry into the US I
would hope that the INS would need more than just a suspicion!). Where
is this proof derived from? Just the "record" from the INS of Olga's past,
the current K1 Fianc&eacute; petition I filed and/or any oral statements
given to INS officials? Can they say obtain testimony from John Miller
and Olga's other friends in Arizona?</li>

<li>
What is Administrative Review? Is it just a reapproval or denial?</li>

<li>
Assuming the Administrative Review is favorable what is the next step?
Do we need to rescheduled another interview in Warsaw or is her visa approved
and we just need to pick it up? Also, how long of a process is it for Administrative
Review? Can we get them to hasten the rescheduling of the interview in
Warsaw?</li>
</ul>

<h2>
Regarding the law</h2>
I've spent some time researching INS Interim Decisions and found the following
information:
<h3>
Marriage Fraud</h3>
From <i>INTERNATIONAL MATCHMAKING ORGANIZATIONS: A REPORT TO CONGRESS</i>:
<blockquote><font color="#009900">.. One must also remember that fraud
may take two basic forms. First, the marriage may be one in name only,
for the sole purpose of securing immigration benefits; often money is exchanged
in these cases. Second, the immigrant may feign interest in the U.S. citizen
or LPR spouse, only to abandon him or her after the marriage. In either
type of fraud, the immigrant may be a woman or a man.</font></blockquote>
No money was exchanged and Olga never attempted to secure an immigration
benefit.
<p>According the the I-129F form itself, it states:
<blockquote><font color="#009900">What are the penalties for committing
marriage fraud or submitting false information or both?</font>
<p><font color="#009900">Title 18, United States Code, Section 100 states
that whoever <u>willfully and knowingly falsifies a material fact, makes
a false statement, or makes use of a false document</u> will be fined up
to $10,000 or imprisoned up to five years, or both.</font>
<p><font color="#009900">Title 8, United States Code, Section 1325 states
that any individual who <u>knowingly enters into a marriage contract for
the purpose of evading any provision of the immigration laws</u> shall
be imprisoned for not more than five years, or fined not more than $250,000,
or both.</font></blockquote>
<font color="#000000">Again Olga never applied for any INS benefit or visa
so she did not actually evade any provision of the immigration laws nor
did she falsify a material fact, make a false statement or make use of
a false document. She was never found guilty under Title 18 of the USC
Section 100 nor fined nor imprisoned.</font><font color="#000000"></font>
<p>This part looks bad:
<blockquote><font color="#009900">Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection
(b) no petition shall be approved if (1) the alien has previously been
accorded, or has sought to be accorded, an immediate relative or preference
status as the spouse of a citizen of the United States or the spouse of
an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence, by reason of a marriage
determined by the Attorney General to have been entered into for the purpose
of evading the immigration laws or (2) the Attorney General has determined
that the alien has attempted or conspired to enter into a marriage for
the purpose of evading the immigration laws.</font></blockquote>
Again the phrase "conspired to enter into a marriage for the purposes of
evading the immigration laws". From my understanding conspired means "to
join in a secret agreement to do an unlawful or wrongful act or an act
which becomes unlawful as a result of the secret agreement" and could be
construed to mean that Olga intended to try. But how do you prove or disprove
such intent?
<blockquote><font color="#009900">The Service has previously determined
that a variety of evidence may be used to establish a good-faith marriage,
and a self-petitioner should submit the best evidence available. Evidence
of good faith at the time of marriage may include, but is not limited to,
proof that one spouse has been listed as the other's spouse on insurance
policies, property leases, income tax forms, or bank accounts; and testimony
or other evidence regarding courtship, wedding ceremony, shared residence
and experiences. Matter of Laureano, 19 I&amp;N Dec. 1 (BIA 1983). Other
types of readily available evidence might include the birth certificates
of children born to the relationship; police, medical, or court documents
providing information about the relationship; and affidavits of persons
with personal knowledge of the relationship. Self-petitioners who submit
affidavits are encouraged to submit affidavits from more than one person.
Other types of evidence may also be submitted; the Service will consider
any relevant credible evidence.</font></blockquote>
Since Olga's marriage was so short all of this will be hard to prove. She
did get pregnant and have an abortion. Not sure if this would help.
<blockquote><font color="#009900">The Act does not define a "good-faith"
marriage or provide guidelines for evaluating the bona fides of a marriage;
however, persons applying for immigration benefits based on a marriage
are generally required to establish that they entered into the marriage
in good faith, and a significant body of case law has developed concerning
the interpretation of this requirement. It has long been held that a marriage
that is entered into for the primary purpose of circumventing the immigration
laws, referred to as a fraudulent or sham marriage, cannot be recognized
as enabling a spouse to obtain immigration benefits. Lutwak v. United States,
344 U.S. 604 (1953) and Matter of Phillis, 15 I&amp;N Dec. 385 (BIA 1975).
A spousal petition will not be denied, however, solely because the spouses
are not living together and the marriage is no longer viable. Matter of
McKee, 17 I&amp;N Dec. 332 (BIA 1980). <u>The key factor in determining
whether a person entered into a marriage in good faith is whether he or
she intended to establish a life together with the spouse at the time of
the marriage</u>. The person's conduct after marriage is relevant only
to the extent that it bears upon his or her subjective state of mind at
the time of the marriage. <u>Separation from the other spouse, even shortly
after the marriage took place, does not prove, by itself, that a marriage
was not entered into in good faith</u>. Bark v. INS, 511 F.2d 1200 (9th
Cir. 1975).</font></blockquote>
Olga said to me that she had hoped that her marriage to John were work
out but that she realized that she did not love this man and that the marriage
would not result in a lifetime together so she decided to divorce and not
attempt to file for any INS benefits.
<p>In <b>Interim Decision #3380</b>:
<blockquote><font color="#009900">It is long settled that <u>inadmissibility
for immigration fraud does not ensue from the mere purchase of fraudulent
documents, absent an attempt to fraudulently use the document for immigration
purposes</u>. Matter of Kai Hing Hui, 15 I&amp;N Dec. 288 (BIA 1975); Matter
of Sarkissian, 10 I&amp;N Dec. 109 (BIA 1962); Matter of Box, 10 I&amp;N
Dec. 87 (BIA 1962); accord Matter of D-L- &amp; A-M-, 20 I&amp;N Dec. 409
(BIA 1991); cf. Matter of Serna, supra (stating that mere possession is
not a crime involving moral turpitude).</font></blockquote>
In this interim decision the respondent "Obviously, the respondent admits
to procuring one document in the form of a fraudulent birth certificate.
The respondent testified that he purchased the birth certificate in Los
Angeles, California, for approximately $400 or $500 so that he could obtain
employment. He then used the birth certificate to procure by fraud a social
security number, and he used both documents to seek to procure a passport.
The latter document was necessary in order for the respondent to be able
to travel into and out of the United States and to aid him in obtaining
employment". Still, dissenting opinions write:
<blockquote><font color="#009900">Initially, I note that the conduct of
the respondent on which the Immigration Judge and the majority rely in
finding the respondent to be inadmissible under section 212(a)(6)(C)(i)
of the Act is based on his conviction for offering a United States birth
certificate obtained from a friend to obtain a United States passport.
The statute under which the respondent was convicted covers conduct that
is engaged in with an intent to defraud the United States. It does not
require, in every instance, that the conduct engaged in be engaged in with
the intent, or with the result, of obtaining a “benefit . . . under this
Act.” The term “this Act” in section 212(A)(6)(C)(i) refers to the Immigration
and Nationality Act.</font><font color="#009900"></font>
<p><u><font color="#009900">Thus, an individual could be convicted under
18 U.S.C. &sect; 1028(a)(4) without there being any specific evidence that
the individual had any intent to act, or actually did act to obtain a “benefit
under this Act.” Cf. section 212(a)(6)(C)(i) of the Act. There is nothing
in the record of conviction before us, nor in the testimony or other&nbsp;
documentation in the record before us, that indicates that the respondent
engaged in the conduct resulting in his conviction for possession of a
false identification document to obtain a “benefit under [the] Act.”</font></u><font color="#009900"></font>
<p><u><font color="#009900">Moreover, neither employment, nor the ability
to travel necessarily constitutes a “benefit under this Act.” No matter
how powerful the majority may wish to make the reach of the Immigration
and Nationality Act, it does not extend to the constitutional rights to
work and to travel. As should be self-evident, an individual may be prosecuted
under federal criminal law for a violation of using false documents “to
defraud the United States,” but not be convicted of an offense that involves
fraud or a material misrepresentation to obtain a “benefit under [the]
Act.” As the respondent argues, he was convicted only of possession of
identification documents, not of using them to procure admission or any
other benefit under the Act. His conviction is for possessing the document
with the intent to defraud the United States. No more; no less.</font></u><u><font color="#009900"></font></u>
<p><font color="#009900">Even if the respondent’s testimony is considered
to establish that the birth certificate was used to seek to obtain a passport,
I would question whether seeking to obtain a passport is an act that is
covered by the phrase in section 212(a)(6)(C)(i) that refers to seeking
to procure or procuring a “benefit under [the] Act.” Issuance of a passport
is an act of the United States Government that provides a citizen with
a document. One who is a citizen or seeks to document the status of being
a citizen by obtaining a passport is not seeking a “benefit under [the]
Act,” as the Act applies, by definition, only to noncitizens.</font></blockquote>
Further, in <b>Interim Decision #3372</b>
<blockquote><u><font color="#009900">The principal elements of the ground
of excludability contained in section 212(a)(6)(C)(i) of the Act pertinent
to our determination are (1) fraud or (2) willfulness and (3) materiality.
Fraud or a willful misrepresentation may be committed by the presentation
of either an oral or written statement to a United States Government official.
Matter of Y-G-, 20 I&amp;N Dec. 794 (BIA 1994) (requiring that to sustain
a charge of fraud, it must have been perpetrated on United States Government
officials). Fraud requires that the respondent know the falsity of his
or her statement, intend to deceive the Government official, and succeed
in this deception</font></u><font color="#009900">. Matter of G-G-, 7 I&amp;N
Dec. 161 (BIA 1956). See generally Kathleen Sullivan, When Representations
Cross the Line, Bender’s Immigration Bulletin, Vol. 1, No. 11 (Oct. 1996).</font><font color="#009900"></font>
<p><font color="#009900">Fraud or a willful misrepresentation is not limited
to “false testimony,” which requires that the actor have made a false statement
under oath with the subjective intent of obtaining an immigration benefit.

statements made under oath in a question-and-answer statement before a
Service officer in connection with any stage of the processing of a visa
or in a naturalization examination constitutes “false testimony” within
the meaning of 8 U.S.C. &sect; 1101(f)(6), and citing Matter of Ngan, 10

statements, or even all statements made under oath,” but refers to “a statement
made by a witness under oath for the purpose of establishing proof of a
fact to a court or tribunal”), rev'd on other grounds, 464 U.S. 183 (1984).
False testimony under section 101(f)(6) of the Act does not apply to concealment.

<h3>
<font color="#000000">Burden of proof</font></h3>
According to
<blockquote><i>INS Federal Register Publications - 1996</i>
<br><i>FEDERAL REGISTER INTERIM REGULATIONS - 1996</i>
<br><i>Petition to Classify Alien as Immediate Relative of a United States
Citizen or as a Preference Immigrant; Self-Petitioning for Certain Battered
or Abused Spouses and Children [61 FR 13061] [FR 16-96]</i></blockquote>

<blockquote><font color="#009900">A petition must be denied under the provisions
of section 204(c) of the Act if there is substantial and probative evidence
that the self-petitioner has ever attempted or conspired to enter into
a marriage for the purpose of evading the immigration laws. The self-petitioner
does not need to have received a benefit through the attempt or conspiracy.
He or she also need not have been convicted of, or even prosecuted for,
the attempt or conspiracy. Evidence of the attempt or conspiracy, however,
must be contained in the self-petitioner's immigration file.</font></blockquote>
Although this section is regarding self petitioners I'd like to make the
following points:
<ul>
<li>
I don't believe there is substantial and probative evidence that Olga has
attempted or conspired to enter into a marriage for the purpose of evading
the immigration laws if an attempt was never made.</li>

<li>
It says that the petitioner does not need to have received a benefit through
the attempt or conspiracy implying that an attempt was made. I'm not as
sure about conspiracy, how to prove or disprove that.</li>

<li>
How do I tell whether or not such evidence is contained in the self-petitioner's
immigration file.</li>
</ul>
Further it states:
<blockquote><font color="#009900">Section 204(g) of the Act may also apply
to a self-petition. It prohibits the approval of a self-petition if the
marriage creating the relationship to the citizen or permanent resident
took place while the self-petitioner was in deportation, exclusion, or
related proceedings, unless the self-petitioner provides clear and convincing
evidence that the marriage was not entered into for the purpose of obtaining
immigration benefits. <u>This limitation will not apply if the self-petitioner
has lived outside the United States for at least 2 years after the marriage.
</u>The
"clear and convincing" standard places a heavier burden on the petitioner
than the "preponderance of evidence" criteria generally applicable to visa
petitions and self-petitions. Although there may be no proof that the marriage
was fraudulent, a self-petition subject to this restriction must be denied
if the petitioner does not provide "clear and convincing" evidence that
the marriage was entered into in good faith.</font></blockquote>
Olga has been living outside of the US for 4 years.
<p>Further regarding <b>Interim Decision #3086: Matter of Kahy</b>:
<blockquote><font color="#009900">(2) Where the record contains evidence
that a visa petition was previously filed seeking nonquota status for an
alien based on a fraudulent marriage, the burden then shifts to the petitioner
to prove that the alien did not seek to be accorded nonquota status based
on the prior marriage. Section 204(c)(1) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. &sect; 1154(c)(1)
(Supp. IV 1986).</font></blockquote>
So does this mean, since Olga did not previously file seeking an INS benefit
that the burden of prove does <b>not</b> shift to the petitioner? Or can:
<blockquote><font color="#009900">(3) A visa petition may be denied pursuant
to section 204(c)(2) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. &sect; 1154(c)(2) (Supp. IV 1986),
where there is evidence in the record to indicate that an alien previously
conspired to enter into a fraudulent marriage.</font></blockquote>
be construed against Olga based on a conspiracy?
<p>Also here <b>Interim Decision #3203: Matter of Isber</b>:
<blockquote><font color="#009900">Section 204(c) was amended by section
4(a) of the Immigration Marriage Fraud Amendments of 1986 ("IMFA"), Pub.
L. No. 99-639, 100 Stat. 3537, 3543 (1986), 2/ in two ways. First, the
words "or has sought to be accorded," were added after the words "has previously
been accorded." Prior to this amendment, section 204(c) did not apply where
the alien had not actually been granted an immigration benefit on the basis
of his or her marriage, even though it was indubitably fraudulent and even
though the alien had sought to obtain such a benefit. <u>If, for instance,
the petitioner withdrew the visa petition on being confronted with evidence
that the marriage was a sham, the beneficiary was not thereafter barred
from deriving an immigration benefit from another marriage or otherwise.
The addition of the words "or has sought to be accorded" closed this loophole.</u>
There is nothing in the legislative history, however, which suggests that
Congress was not still referring to a "prior marriage." See H.R. Rep. No.
906, 99th Cong., 2d Sess. (1986), reprinted in 1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. 5978.</font></blockquote>
So the loophole they speak of here is that where an action was taken to
obtain INS benefits. Does this imply if no action was taken then no harm
was done? However this appears to kill me:
<blockquote><font color="#009900">IMFA also amended section 204(c) to add
a new clause prohibiting the approval of a visa petition if "the Attorney
General has determined that the alien has attempted or conspired to enter
into a marriage for the purpose of evading the immigration laws." 100 Stat.
at 3543. <u>Congress thereby extended the perpetual bar of section 204(c)
to cases where an alien had entered, or attempted or conspired to enter,
into a sham marriage for the purpose of obtaining an immigration benefit,
but no benefit was actually sought.</u> Situations such as these could
result, for instance, in connection with undercover Service investigations
of marriage fraud rings. Again, there was no suggestion that Congress was
not still referring to prior marriages.</font></blockquote>
Unless this can be construed to only be applicable to marriage fraud rings,
of which I don't think you can construe Olga's single incident to a marriage
fraud ring.
<p>OK, this ones a tough one:
<blockquote><font color="#009900">It is well established that fraud or
willful misrepresentation of a material fact in the procurement or attempted
procurement of a visa, or other documentation, must be made to an authorized
official of the United States Government in order for excludability under
section 212(a)(6)(C)(i) of the Act to be found. See Matter of D-L- &amp;
A-M-, 20 I&amp;N Dec. 3162 (BIA 1991); Matter of Shirdel, 19 I&amp;N Dec.
33 (BIA 1984); Matter of L-L-, 9 I&amp;N Dec. 324 (BIA 1961). The record
contains no evidence that the applicant practiced fraud or made a willful
misrepresentation to a United States Government official in procuring or
in seeking to procure documentation. Accordingly, we find that the issue
at hand is whether the applicant is excludable for fraud or willful misrepresentation
of a material fact in seeking to procure entry into the United States.</font><font color="#009900"></font>
<p><font color="#009900">Prior to its amendment by section 6(a) of the
Immigration Marriage Fraud Amendments of 1986, Pub. L. No. 99-639, 100
Stat. 3537, 3543-44 (effective Nov. 10, 1986) ("1986 Amendments"), and
later by the Immigration Act of 1990, Pub. L. No. 101-649, 104 Stat. 4978
("1990 Act"), section 212(a)(19) of the Act rendered excludable</font><font color="#009900"></font>
<p><font color="#009900">[a]ny alien who seeks to procure, or has sought
to procure, or has procured a visa or other documentation, or seeks to
enter the United States, by fraud, or by willfully misrepresenting a material
fact.</font><font color="#009900"></font>
<p><font color="#009900">Interpreting that version of the law, the Attorney
General held that the first clause of section 212(a)(19), relating to documents,
was both prospective and retrospective, but the second clause, relating
to entry into the United States, was prospective only. Matter of M-, 6
I&amp;N Dec. 752 (BIA 1955); Matter of M-, 6 I&amp;N Dec. 149 (BIA, A.G.
1954); see also Matter of Shirdel, supra, at 34-35. Consequently, an alien
whose fraud or material misrepresentations related to the procurement of
documents was forever barred from admission, unless a waiver was obtained,
while a fraud or misrepresentation which related to an alien's entry invalidated
only that entry and did not preclude a subsequent entry that was otherwise
regular. See Matter of Shirdel, supra. Accordingly, in Matter of Shirdel
this Board stated, "We closely scrutinize the factual basis for a possible
finding of excludability under the first clause of section 212(a)(19) for
fraud in the procurement of entry documents since such a finding perpetually
bars an alien from admission." Id. at 35; see also Matter of Healy and
Goodchild, 17 I&amp;N Dec. 22 (BIA 1979).</font></blockquote>
This seems to suggest to me that the INS will look forward and backward
in time to see if you committed any documentation related fraud or have
procured and INS benefit based on fraud, however it will only look forward
in time if you are attempting to enter the US.
<p>Can the argument be made that "seeks to procure" really means "at this
current time" while "sought to procure" would mean that they had actually
performed the action of seeking to procure in the past and therefore would
need to show evidence of an action to procure?
<p>Also:
<blockquote><font color="#009900">Since the fraud exclusion ground has
been amended, an alien is now excludable under section 212(a)(6)(C)(i)
of the Act not only if he "seeks" to procure but also if he "has sought
to procure or has procured" an entry into the United States by fraud or
the willful misrepresentation of a material fact. Accordingly, the provision
relating to seeking entry, like the provision relating to the procurement
of documents, is now both prospective and retrospective, and an alien who
is found excludable for seeking to procure entry by fraud or the willful
misrepresentation of a material fact is now forever barred from admission
to the United States unless a waiver is obtained. Therefore, we will "closely
scrutinize" the factual basis for a possible finding of excludability under
this provision, since such a finding may perpetually bar the applicant
from admission. See Matter of Shirdel, supra.</font></blockquote>
Notice here that the phrase "seeks to procure" is always related to "entry
into the United States". Olga is not seeking to procure entry into the
US based on her marriage to John rather she is seeking it based on our
K1.
<p>Another thought is that all of this that I've found so far directly
involves some INS benefit being sought based on an allegedly fraudulent
marriage. In my case Olga's allegedly fraudulent marriage was to somebody
else 4 years ago. The matter at hand is my K1 fianc&eacute; visa petition
and I am not John.
<p>Further:
<blockquote><font color="#009900">In Matter of D-L- &amp; A-M-, supra,
we held that outside of the transit without visa context, an alien is not
excludable for seeking entry by fraud or willful misrepresentation of a
material fact where there is no evidence that the alien presented or intended
to present fraudulent documents or documents containing material misrepresentations
to an authorized official of the United States Government in an attempt
to enter on those documents.</font></blockquote>

<h3>
<font color="#000000">Regarding Overstay</font></h3>
<font color="#000000">A concern of mine is that Olga had entered the US
on March 1995, married Michael Moffat on May 27, 1995 (thus fulfilling
the 90 day requirement of the K1) but was officially divorced from Michael
on May 3, 1996. Olga left the US on Sept 27, 1997. Therefore she was out
of status from May 3, 1996 - September 27, 1997 or for 1 year and 4 months.
Now according to Michael the INS changed laws in 1997 (Illegal Immigration
Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996) and Olga had 180 days
of out of status condition before she would be barred from reentering the
US. According to what I've read so far if the alien is out of status for
1-180 days then there is no barring. If > 180 days but less than 1 year
then there is a 3 year bar (which Olga already passes as she left in 1997
and it's now 2001). If over 1 year then there is a 10 year bar. According
to the IIRIRA Section 301:</font>
<blockquote><font color="#009900">(3) TREATMENT OF UNLAWFUL PRESENCE BEFORE
EFFECTIVE DATE.</font>
<p><font color="#009900">In applying section 212(a)(9)(B) of the Immigration
and Nationality Act, as inserted by paragraph (1), no period before the
title III-A effective date shall be included in a period of unlawful presence
in the United States.</font></blockquote>
<font color="#000000">I believe "title III-A" refers to the effective date
of this act which is April 1, 1997 and that the above means that Olga's
past out of status condition is discarded and the clock starts ticking
from April 1, 1997. Therefore if Olga had left the US after November 1,
1997 she would have been out of status for > 180 days and therefore bared
