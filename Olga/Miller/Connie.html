   Dear Connie,<br>
   <br>
 I see that Jon has declined my Express Mail that I recently sent to you. 
I assume that he did not even read the letter contained inside. I realize 
that you do not have to help Olga and I. I realize that he would rather forget 
that time of his life. But does he realize that he just kicked a man when 
he was down? A good, honest man who has been beaten down to the ground so 
many times this past year. All he needed to do was to sign and return a simple 
little statement whose words were the truthful words that we spoke of on the
phone last November. It would have been very helpful to me and to Olga. But
instead he decided to refuse to help Olga and I. Now I risk spending a lot
of money in an attempt to get Olga here anyway. I risk a lot more emotional 
pain if I am to fail, due in large part to his decision "not to get involved". 
And my daughter also stands to suffer from this. I do not know how I can face
her and tell her that Olga is again not going to be able to come here and
be her mommy. How many times must I break my own daughter's heart! Oh Lord
I hope that this works this time even without Jon's statement because I probably
could not bear the pain if it fails again. For the first time in my life
I'm actually worried that I might go into a more severe depression than I
did last time and may even do something stupid to myself if my attempt fails
this time. He may or may not feel partly responsible for such I cannot tell.
I'm just telling you how I feel and what I worry about. <br>
 <br>
 And, although he may not be fond of Olga, he is condemning her to a miserable
existence should we fail this time. He is also condemning me to a low of
emotional pain as well as my daughter. I find it hard to believe that he
is this heartless, vindictive and cruel. I cannot understand his refusal
to accept my Express Mail and his apparent reluctance to help me. <br>
 <br>
 Connie this is me, Andrew DeFaria, speaking to you. I'm a real person with 
real feelings. Like most people I bleed when pricked and cry when hurt. I 
have been stomped on at just about every turn this past year from my government, 
the INS, Department of State, my Congressmen and Senators. My emotions have 
been frayed and frazzled by so many people I cannot even count them. My patience 
tried time and time again. Yet I have been focused and concentrated on but 
one thing, a thing that I have been desperately trying to achieve for a long 
time and that is to get my own family going again. I want to have babies so
that my daughter would not be an only child. I want a wife and a family filling
my house. I've been knocked down with the economic slowdown, almost lost
my house, almost had to move away from my only family, my daughter, to West
Virginia. I lost my fianc&eacute;e, Olga for a full year now due to these
problems that your husband can help me with. My only contact with her has
been by phone as I can't afford to go out there. I have been kicking and
screaming and trying, trying, trying to put my life back together - back to
where it should be - back to where it was before it all blew up. I do not
want to stop, to give up on my dream to make a family once again. If I fail
this time getting Olga here I do not know how I will survive that blow again.
<br>
 <br>
 The consular's main issue was with Olga and Jon's marriage. Now I must go 
there with nothing in my hand to satisfy this issue with the Embassy.<br>
 <br>
 We talked for a while on the phone last November. I felt that you really 
understood me, Olga and our situation. I thought you agreed that people change 
over time and that you could see how Olga should have another chance. I felt 
that you were a compassionate person and that you were willing to help us. 
Will you give us another chance? Could you not find it in your heart to help 
me before it's too late?<br>
<br>
I've included a copy of a sample statement that my lawyer had drafted up.
Again time is running out for me and I would really appreciate it if you
could do this for me.<br>
