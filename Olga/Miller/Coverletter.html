 Dear John,<br>
 <br>
 The Warsaw Embassy is allowing Olga and I to present our case again and
they will re-examine it. But time is of the essense as they need a response
from us by April 23, 2002 which is 1 year from the last time we were there.
You had said that you would be willing to give me a statement concerning
your relationship with Olga. I have obtained legal counsel and have asked
them to write a sample statement (attached). I hope that you will be able
to use this guide to write a statement for me. This would need to be signed
and notarized and sent back to me as soon as possible. Please let me know
if you are willing to do this for me by contacting me immediately, even before 
you send me the statement. I would like to know that you will do this for 
me before I purchase tickets to travel to Warsaw. I will reimburse any expenses 
you incurr.<br>
 <br>
 I really hope that you will be able to help me. It would greatly improve 
our odds of successfully getting Olga a visa if I have this statement from 
you detailing what you have already told me on the phone back in November. 
I think that the sample statement represents the facts as we discussed them 
fairly accurately. Note that I believe the embassy was concerned about you 
two not living together initially.<br>
 <br>
 I had called your number, 480-820-2415 and it said it was disconnected.
I do not know if you simply changed it to a private number or moved. I vaguely 
remember that you or your wife mentioned that you might be moving. I believe 
I said to let me know your new number if you move. I hope that this letter 
gets through to you in time.<br>
 <br>
 If you have any questions then do not hesitate to call me.<br>
 <br>
 Thank you<br>
