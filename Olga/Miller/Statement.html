<p> Dear Officer,<o:p></o:p></p>
  I am writing to describe the circumstances of my brief marriage to Olga 
Fedoryaka/Moffat  in 1997.  I first met Olga in about November of 1996 at
the mall in Mesa, Arizona. We began dating shortly thereafter. I really enjoyed
spending time with her. As we spent more time together we started talking
about getting married. 
<p>We got married in early 1997, but we didn’t move in together right away 
 because we both had leases on our  apartments that had time left on them. 
 As the first few weeks went by after  getting married, Olga spoke to me about
how she felt we had gotten carried  away and rushed into this. She wasn’t
sure that our attraction to each other  was going to be able to develop into
an enduring relationship.  After about  a month, Olga told me that the best
thing would be for us to file for divorce  and put the whole thing behind 
us.</p>
 
<p>I   never filed any immigration paperwork for Olga, and although I knew 
she was  having some problems with her visa, that wasn’t the reason we got 
married.     We were having a good time dating, got carried away and decided 
to get  married, and then realized that maybe getting married wasn’t the best
thing  for us right then.</p>
 
<p>I   understand that Olga is now engaged to Andrew DeFaria, and it seems 
like  they have had a lot of time to make sure that this is the right thing 
for  the two of them.  I wish them the best in their future together.</p>
 
<p>If   you have any questions, I can be reached at the address above.  </p>
 
<p>I   swear under penalty of perjury that the statements above are true to
the  best of my knowledge.</p>
 
<p>Sincerely,</p>
 
<p><br>
 </p>
 
<p>John A. Miller</p>
