  <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
    <li>The terms of this paragraph 11 and its subparts shall control and
resolve any questions and/or claims for spousal maintenance.</li>
    <li>Olga waives any other different or further claims as and for spousal
maintenance; to which she might otherwise be entitled under the principles
of the community property law and/or the laws of the State of California,
except as provided in this paragraph 11 and its subparts</li>

month or more.</li>
    <li>If Olga is not earning, receiving or is not capable of earning gross

no sums of money shall be paid by Andrew to Olga for spousal maintenance</li>
      <li>If the parties have been married for more than three (3) but less
than five (5) years, Andrew shall pay spousal maintenance to Olga, each month,
for a period of twelve (12) months, in an amount equal to 1% of all "monies
earned" by Andrew on an annual basis. As an example: if Andrew's total "monies

Olga in the amount of $800 per month for a period of twelve (12) months.</li>

five (5) years but less than fifteen (15) years, Andrew shall pay spousal
maintenance to Olga, each month, for a period of eighteen (18) months, in

Andrew would pay spousal maintenance to Olga in the amount of $1,200 per
month for a period of eighteen (18) months.</li>
      <li>If the parties have been married for a period of time in excess
of fifteen (15) years, Andrew shall pay spousal maintenance to Olga, each
month, for a period of twenty-four (24) months, in the amount equal to 2%
of all "monies earned" by Andrew, on an annual basis. As an example: if Andrew's
total "monies earned" on an annual basis were $80,000 per year and the parties
have had been married for seventeen (17) years, Andrew would pay spousal
maintenance to Olga in the amount of $1,600 per month for a period of twenty-four
(24) months.</li>
      <li>The term "monies earned," as used in the paragraph 11 and its subparts
and as used to define and quantify the amount of spousal maintenance to be

services rendered to an employer, or in the course of self-employment as
an independent contractor. The term "monies earned" as used in paragraph
11 and its subparts shall not include increases in value, dividends, income,
or profits resulting from the property and assets, or the sale of property
and assets listed on Exhibit A to this Agreement.</li>
      <li>Andrew and Olga agree that these provisions with regard to the
payment of spousal maintenance from Andrew to Olga are non-modifiable both
as to the amount of spousal maintenance to be paid and as to the period of
time during which it shall be paid. Both Andrew and Olga Expressly waive
any jurisdictional authority of any court of competent jurisdiction to in
anyway effect a modification of the provisions in this Agreement with regard
to the payment of spousal maintenance, and further specifically waive the
right of any court to retain jurisdiction to do so. The only exception to
the non-modifiability of the provisions for the payment of spousal maintenance
as contained in this agreement is the death of Olga, and/or the death of
Andrew. Andrew's obligation to pay spousal maintenance, if in any amount,
pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement shall terminate upon the death
of Olga and/or the death of Andrew.</li>

shall qualify as "alimony or separate maintenance" pursuant to Section 71
of the Internal Revenue Code, and payments made pursuant to this Agreement
shall be includable in Wife's income and deductible from Husband's income.</li>

of the advice of independent legal counsel; with regard to the review and
execution of this Premarital Agreement. Andrew has sought and received the

the same.</li>

or otherwise) of his sole and separate property consisting of those items
of property and assets set forth in Exhibit A; in the manner he chooses without
first seeking the authorization, consent or knowledge of Olga. Olga is free
