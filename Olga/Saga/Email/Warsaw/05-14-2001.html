Dear Mr. DeFaria:  <br>
<br>
We undestand your concern.  We reviewed your fiance-visa petition for Ms. 
Fedoryaka very carefully before we finally decided to send it to the Immigration
and Naturalization Service in the United States.  During the visa interview
new facts arose that the consular officer thought were not available at the
time your petition was approved by the INS. Therefore, with accordance to
the immigration law, we had to refer Ms. Fedoryaka's complete paperwork to
the INS office that approved your I-129F petition for her.<br>
<br>
Today, we sent Ms. Fedoryaka's case to INS in Laguna Niguel by registered 
mail no. 4382893.   <br>
<br>
Sincerely, U.S. Embassy, Warsaw  </div>
