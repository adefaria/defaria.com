<div class="moz-text-html" style="font-family: Arial; ">  Hello. 
<p>I had sent the following fax on Tuesday, May 8, 2001. You should have received
it on Wednesday, May 9, 2001. I am still waiting for a response so I am faxing
again. On Thursday, May 10, 2001 I spoke with a consular on the phone. He
said that he had written up the explanation and had given it to a secretary
to email to me. I have yet to receive that email. </p>
<p>He had also said that he had sent the file to the INS section in Vienna 
by certified mail on Friday, May 4, 2001. Vienna has still not received that
file. </p>
<p>I'm sorry to be bothering you however I am very anxious to have this matter
resolved and to have my fianc&eacute;e with me here in the US. I can proceed
no further until I receive a written explanation for this administrative review
process which I believe I should have been offered when I was in Warsaw back
in April. </p>
<p>Please send me this information as soon as possible. </p>
<p>Thanks. </p>

<p>Dear Sirs, </p>
<p>My name is Andrew DeFaria and I petitioned for a K1 Fianc&eacute; Visa 
for Olga Fedoryaka and received an approval from the California Service Center
on January 2, 2001 (Receipt Number WAC-01-016-53708). We were scheduled for
an interview in Warsaw on April 23, 2001 and assigned the Case ID WRW2001009031. 
My fiancee and I had went to the embassy in Warsaw for our interview was told
that the petition was sent to the INS in Vienna for Administrative Review.
The consular there said that I could check back in a week or two to obtain
a tracking # so I could track the case in Vienna. I am requesting that tracking
number. </p>
<p>I am also formally requesting to know the official reason why our petition 
is being sent for Administrative Review. I would like to know if you require 
any further information from me or my fianc&eacute; regarding this issue so
that you can make a speedy determination. Please let me know this. </p>
<p>The following information should help you contact me: </p>
<blockquote>Andrew DeFaria <br>
6187 Ellerbrook Way <br>
San Jose, California 95123-5012 <br>
Phone: (408)-363-0562 <br>
Fax: (408)-363-0562 <br>
Email: Andrew@DeFaria.com</blockquote>
 Email or fax would be quicker and therefore preferred. 
  <p>Also, I would appreciate it if you could give me the phone number(s) 
for the INS in Vienna or wherever I am supposed to call to actually track 
this case. The numbers that I found were: </p>
  <blockquote><li> Vienna Consular Section 011-43-1-31339-0</li>
    <li> Vienna INS 011-43-1-31339-2046</li>
    </blockquote>
 But I'm not sure if these are the correct numbers. 
    <p>I would like to resolve any problems that you may have with my petition 
so that I may be able to bring my loved one home to join my family as quickly 
as possible. </p>
    <p>Sincerely </p>
    <p>Andrew DeFaria</p>
