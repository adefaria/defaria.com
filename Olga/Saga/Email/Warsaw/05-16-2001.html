 I'm sorry but this does not satisfy my original request (attached) which 
states: 
<blockquote>I am also formally requesting to know the official reason why 
our petition is being sent for Administrative Review. I would like to know 
if you require any further information from me or my fianc&eacute; regarding 
this issue so that you can make a speedy determination. Please let me know 
this.</blockquote>
 Which, for some reason, is not shown in your "Original Message" section. 
I am requesting to know the official reason my petition was sent for administrative 
review on the advice and request of my immigration lawyer. Specifically what
new facts arose, why they are a problem and what do we need to do to satisfy
the INS and the Embassy. The above does not address this. Please respond
with the official explanation so that my attorney may be able to start to
prepare our case. </div>
