Dear Mr. DeFaria:  <br>
<br>
According to the regulations of the 9 Foreign Affairs Manual, Part 41, the 
consular officer should suspend action and return the petition to the approving
INS office for reconsideration, if the facts of a beneficiary's prior marital
history are not consistent with information in the approved petition.  During
Ms. Fedoryaka's visa interview, several pieces of information surfaced that
the consular officer believed were not available to INS.  The consular officer
focused on Ms. Fedoryaka's entry on K-1 visa in 1995, her stay without status
in the U.S. and subsequent marriages and divorces from American citizens.
The above-mentioned issues made the post question Ms. Fedoryaka's true intentions
in the whole immigration process since 1995.   <br>
<br>
Therefore, we returned Ms. Fedoryaka's complete paperwork to the INS office 
in Laguna Niguel.  You may wish to contact INS directly and furnish them with
additional information  that may support your case.  <br>
<br>
Sincerely, U.S. Embassy, Warsaw     </div>
