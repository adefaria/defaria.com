<p> Which <b>exact</b> facts of the beneficiary's prior marital history were 
not consistent with the information in the approved petition? We had made 
no attempt to hide the fact that my fiancee was married twice before while 
in the US, in fact we provided divorce decrees for both marriages! So I fail
to see what facts about my fiancees prior marital history were inconsistent 
with the information in the approved petition. Could you clarify this?</p>
<p> And according to 9 FAM 42.43 N2.1 Petitions Approved in Error: </p>
<blockquote>The approval of a petition is usually considered to be prima facie
evidence that the alien beneficiary has met the petition requirements. Unless
a petition has been approved in error, the petition can only be returned
if the consular officer knows, or has reason to believe, that the beneficiary
is not entitled to status. Knowledge and reason to believe must be based
upon evidence that the INS did not have available at the time of adjudication.
This evidence often arises as a result of or during the consular officer&#8217;s
interview. <u>Reason to believe must be more than mere conjecture or speculation</u>
&#8212;there must exist probability, <u>supported by evidence</u> that the alien
is not entitled to status.</blockquote>
 And 9 FAM 42.43 N2.2 Cases of Sham Marriages: 
  <blockquote>INS has minimum evidentiary standards that must be established 
before revocation proceedings may begin. These minimum evidentiary standards 
are: 
    <p>(1) A written statement from one or both of the parties to the marriage 
or documentary evidence that money exchanged hands; or </p>
    <p>(2) <u>Factual evidence developed by the consular officer that would 
convince a reasonable person that the marriage was a sham marriage entered 
into to evade immigration laws.</u></p>
    </blockquote>
 Where is this factual evidence? Please be detailed. I need to see this factual
evidence in order for me and my lawyer to adequately prepare our case. 
    <p>Specifically, as stated in 9 FAM 42.43 N2 Returning Petition: "In
most instances when action is suspended the consular officer shall: (1) Prepare 
a covering memorandum which constitutes a&nbsp; comprehensive report to INS
explaining in detail the reasons why the beneficiary appears not to be entitled
to status", I would like that report (and neither the embassy in Warsaw nor
the INS here in California has provided me with that information - and remember
the INS in California does not respond to my requests (see below)). </p>
 It is a practical impossibility to contact the INS office in Laguna Niguel. 
I have been trying for weeks. Their number is <b>always</b> busy. I have faxed
them and they do not respond. It is also an impossibility to provide them
with additional information when both your office and the INS here in Laguna
Niguel refuse to clearly state exactly what the problem is! Vague terms of
"several pieces of information" provide me no information of what additional
information I might be able to submit to support my case because the case
and/or the problem has never been clearly articulated!
