OK, it's been long enough now so I've been trying to track down or trace
<span class="moz-txt-citetags"></span>this registered mail by the number
you cited above. The INS service center <span class="moz-txt-citetags"></span>
in Laguna Niguel says that they have no record of this in their computers.
<span class="moz-txt-citetags"></span>It's been over 2 months now and I still
do not know exactly why my fianc&eacute;e <span class="moz-txt-citetags"></span>
and I are being delayed from starting our life together. I called the Post
<span class="moz-txt-citetags"></span>Office in Laguna Niguel and they say
that that registered mail number you <span class="moz-txt-citetags"></span>
cite above is no good, that the number should be at least 9 digits and <span class="moz-txt-citetags"></span>
should start with either an "R" or an "RR".  Do you have any different <span class="moz-txt-citetags"></span>
number for this registered mail that is 9 digits long and/or starts with
a <span class="moz-txt-citetags"></span>letter? <span class="moz-txt-citetags"><br>
<br>
</span><span class="moz-txt-citetags"></span>Failing that I need to send
a form to the Post Office where you initially<span class="moz-txt-citetags">
 </span>sent this mail in Warsaw. I would need that address. <br>
<br>
<span class="moz-txt-citetags"></span>Finally, in a last ditch effort, again
I inquire that according to my <span class="moz-txt-citetags"></span>reading
of the laws pertaining to the proper procedures that you are <span class="moz-txt-citetags"></span>
required to follow regarding returning an approved petition, you are<span class="moz-txt-citetags">
 </span>supposed to write a memorandum that is not based in suspicious nor
<span class="moz-txt-citetags"></span>conjecture - rather based in facts,
that explains in details the new facts <span class="moz-txt-citetags"></span>
that arose that lead you to believe that the beneficiary was not entitled
<span class="moz-txt-citetags"></span>to status to accompany the petition
that you send back to the approving <span class="moz-txt-citetags"></span>
INS center. For about 2 months now I have been pleading with you to obtain
<span class="moz-txt-citetags"></span>a copy of that memorandam. You have
consistently refused to acknowledge my <span class="moz-txt-citetags"></span>
requests.  I would like to know why. Am I not entitled to know these <span class="moz-txt-citetags"></span>
facts? Must I wait until the INS decides the case before I become privy to
<span class="moz-txt-citetags"></span>these facts? If so then how could I
possibly submit evidence to support my <span class="moz-txt-citetags"></span>
case when I know not what evidence the INS wants?!? Please answer these <span class="moz-txt-citetags"></span>
questions for me!<br>
<span class="moz-txt-citetags"></span><span class="moz-txt-citetags"></span><br>
Meantime I have my Congressman inquiring of your boss why you refuse to <span class="moz-txt-citetags"></span>
comply with this simple, and clearly stated request, for 2 months.     </div>
