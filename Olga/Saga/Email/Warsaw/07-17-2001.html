Dear Mr. DeFaria:<br>
<br>
The tracking number you refer to is an internal number used for diplomatic 
pouch.  It does not correspond with any U.S. postal service tracking numbers. 
 <br>
<br>
We are unable to release a copy of the memorandum sent to INS. This is interdepartmental
government correspondence which is considered part of the visa process. 
In general, we can tell you that the memo called into question whether or
not INS was aware of all facts pertaining to Ms. Fedoryaka's previous stay
in U.S.  <br>
<br>
Sincerely, U.S. Embassy, Warsaw  <br>
