  Does this tracking number track? If so could you please initiate a trace
on that mail through your system because the petition has not arrived at
the CSC yet.  <br>
<br>
OK, I can understand this. But ain't I part of this visa process?  <br>
<br>
What I don't understand, and perhaps you could clear this all up for me,
is if my petition were denied then you'd be required to issue me a written
statement as to why you denied me. But my petition was sent back for administrative
review. Why then are you not similarly required to tell me exactly why my
petition is being delayed? And by that I mean not just that it's being sent
back for review but the real reasons why it's being sent back for review,
not vague reasons like the "In general" statement below.<br>
<br>
It's also odd that you have told me that I can submit additional evidence
to the INS when I don't know what evidence is required because I don't know
the real reasons why my petition is being reviewed. You keep neglecting to
address that point.  <br>
<br>
It may be just "that's how the laws/regulations are currently written" but
if so it does seem odd that applicants must be informed in writing why they
were denied but not why their being reviewed.  <br>
<br>
Yes I know this. What doesn't make any sense is what could possibly be these
facts that you allude to that the INS was not aware of? I can only go off
of the statements that you had said to me in Warsaw and once on the phone. 
 <br>
<br>
You seem particularly concerned that my fiancee was married twice before.
However both marriages were disclosed and the start dates were duly noted.
Both divorce decrees were also included with the end dates. So the INS was
fully aware of both marriages. What facts could have surfaced that the INS
did not know about?  <br>
<br>
You also mentioned that you were concerned about my fiancee leaving the US
with her 1st ex husband. Well contrary to popular opinion not all ex spouses
hate each other! I know, I'm still very good friends with my ex wife. My
fiancee's 1st ex husband is still good friends with my fiancee. I spoke with
him and he only wants to help her. In fact that's what he was doing when
he helped her get out of the US. He was concerned about her overstaying in
the US. He went to an immigration attorney about this and they informed him
of the change in the INS laws in 1997 and told him that my fiancee should
get out of the US before 180 days if she did not want to be banned from reentry
in the future. And that's what he did. He urged her to leave the US and helped
her make arrangements to leave. There is nothing illegal or wrong about this
and there is no place on the INS forms to fill in such information, because
it's pretty much irrelevant.  <br>
<br>
You had also mentioned that you were concerned about my corresponding with
my fiancee's 1st ex husband. Let me inform you that I had only contacted
him after I met my fiancee, after I submitted the K1 and even after we were
approved and had gotten the interview date. Again there is no place on any
of the INS forms to mention such facts because again they are pretty much
irrelevant. And again there is nothing wrong with contacting previous husbands
or wives of foreign fiancees.<br>
<br>
Look I know it may look suspicious but from what I understand you are not
supposed to return approved petitions unless you have facts, not suspicions,
that the beneficiary is not entitled to status. As such I'm sure you can
see my concerns about what those facts could possibly be.  <br>
<br>
Listen I'm a reasonable guy, honestly. I'm not trying to circumvent nor fraud
the INS and neither is my fiancee. We are trying to proceed in the correct
and legal fashion. I'm just trying get to the root of what the real problem
is here so I can understand it.  <br>
<br>
Put yourself in my shoes. Wouldn't you want to know what the problem is?
Wouldn't you be extremely frustrated if you could not get that information?
