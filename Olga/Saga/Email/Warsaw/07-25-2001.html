Dear Mr. DeFaria:  <br>
<br>
Thank you for your correspondence dated July 23, 2001.  We appreciate your 
interest and concern regarding your fiancee's petition.    <br>
<br>
INS approval of a petition does not guarantee visa issuance.  The interview 
process is a final step to both establish the nature and bona fides of a relationship
as well as gather all information pertaining to the applicant's case.  <br>
<br>
We have not denied the visa, but rather returned it to INS for administrative
review.  There is a difference. The petition was returned in light of facts
which arose during the interview that the officer feels were unavailable
to INS at the time of approval.  Should INS find no grounds to reverse their
approval, the petition will be returned to us for adjudication.  Per your
request we will initiate a trace of the file.  <br>
<br>
Sincerely, U.S. Embassy, Warsaw  <br>

<ol>
  <li>It seems pretty apparent at this point that Warsaw will not address
the issues that I raised and they will not tell me what this pertinent new
facts supposedly &nbsp;were.</li>
  <li>I don't think that consulates are charged with the duty of adjudicating
anything. They are in the business of issuing or refusing to issue visas
when given a visa application - that's all (with respect to fianc&eacute;e
visas at least). If the issue then all is well. If they refuse then they
must do so in writing. In my case they did neither - they neither issued
nor refused my visa application. However they also did not issue me a written
notice of why they refused. By using the term adjudication above it seems
clear that they are attempting to play Department of Justice when they should
stick to being in the Department of Defense!</li>
