  I understand [ that reviewed is not denied ]<br>
<br>
  [ facts unavailable to the INS at the time of approval ] I don't understand.
Or rather I don't understand what those facts could possibly be. So I will
ask again: What I don't understand, and perhaps you could clear this all
up for me, is if my petition were denied then you'd be required to issue
me a written statement as to why you denied me. But my petition was sent
back for administrative review. Why then are you not similarly required to
tell me exactly why my petition is being delayed? And by that I mean not
just that it's being sent back for review but the real reasons why it's being
sent back for review, not vague statements offered so far.  I<br>
<br>
t's also odd that you have told me that I can submit additional evidence
to the INS when I don't know what evidence is required because I don't know
the real reasons why my petition is being reviewed. You keep neglecting to
address that point (and I guess I'll just keep asking...).  <br>
<br>
It may be just "that's how the laws/regulations are currently written" but
if so it does seem odd that applicants must be informed in writing why they
were denied but not why their being reviewed.  <br>
<br>
If [ my petition is reapproved ] did happen would my K1 be extended automatically?
Or do I have to repetition? Would we simply be scheduled for another interview?
