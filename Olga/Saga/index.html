<h1>The Saga</h1>
<div align="Left">This is the story of my relationship with Olga Fedoryaka. 
It will be long and the story is complicated. And because of the problems 
we are currently having with the INS, the duration of time involved, the history
and numerous contacts, lies, messages, etc, I feel compelled to document this
if for no other reason as to get it relatively straight. <br>

 I will probably ramble on and on and edit these series of web pages for
a long time. The intend is to get some sort of documentation in a close to 
chronological order. As such I should probably start at...<br>
  <h2>The Beginning - Meeting<br>
  </h2>
 In the summer of 2000 I traveled to Kiev, Ukraine with A Foreign Affiar
for the purposes of finding a wife. It was not a mail order bride sitatuion. 
I went to meet eligible, marriage minded women. I was hoping I'd meet a special 
woman but figured if that failed at least I'd have a good vacation and an 
opportunity to visit the city where my mother grew up.<br>
  <br>
 During the trip I meet Olga Fedoryaka and dated here. Initially I didn't 
think that she was interested in me but on our second date things went better 
and by the end of the trip I had cancelled all my other dates to be with Olga.
I remember on the plane ride back regretting that I didn't ask her to marry
me before returning to the US. More of this story is available in my <a href="LoveLetter.html">
Love Letter</a>
  to her.<br>
  <br>
 When I returned to the US I sent Olga flowers and we continued our relationship. 
In September I returned to Kiev and asked her to marry me. I also started 
filing a K1 petition. The petition was sent to the INS Service Center in Laguna
Niguel (AKA CSC) in October 2001. I returned again in December and we spent
the holidays together. When I returned to the US I found out that my K1 petition
was approved on 1/2/ 2001. <br>

  <h2>Disaster #2 - April 2001</h2>
  <h3>Initial Interview<br>
  </h3>
 We had our fianc&eacute;e interview scheduled for April 23, 2001. I flew 
out to Warsaw, Poland and flew Olga out to attend the interview. I as very 
happy and really looking forward to getting Olga back home to California. 
But she was not allowed to come back with me. <br>
  <br>
 We arrived on time to the embassy for the interview and after proceeding 
through security got in line to present our papers. We were then told to wait
to be called. Olga was nervous, "What if they don't let me go?" she asked.
I told her "Why wouldn't they? They let you go before". Finally we were called
up to the window.<br>
  <br>
 The consular officer (Let's call him Dave - none of the consular officers 
identified themselves by name) took Olga's paperwork and looked it over. He
mentioned that Olga was in the US before, which I knew about. Olga was in
the US from 1995 - 1997. She came on a K1 visa and married a man named Michael
Moffat. That marriage didn't work out and they divorced a year later. She
stayed in the US and later married another man named Jon Miller but she realized
that that was a mistake and attempted to get that marriage anulled but couldn't.
So she divorced him too. Then Michael came back around and help Olga leave
the country and join him in Hong Kong. <br>
  <br>
 Dave told us to hold on and walked in the back for a while. He returned
with another consular officer, a blonde haired man who we'll call John. John
asked me to step to the window next door. He <font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">
 asked me why I wanted my fianc&eacute;e. I was not aware that it is customary 
to interview the petitioner at such visa interviews! I told him that I loved 
her and wanted to bring her to America to be my wife. He then asked if I was
aware that my fianc&eacute;e was in the U.S. before. I responded that she
had not been deported. He looked at me very sternly and menacingly, raised 
his voice and scolded me "Now don't be trying to get legal with me!". I told 
him I was not trying to get legal with him I was just trying to inform him 
that she was not deported and apologized. Needless to say at this point I 
was very nervous and intimidated. I did not feel that I needed to be scolded 
by him nor intimidated by him however I was worried if I didn't go along with
whatever he said that he would deny my petition. In other words I felt very
threatened by him. </font>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Next he asked me if I knew 
that she had been married twice before and that he believed that she was just
using me to get a ticket to America. I told him that I was fully aware of
her prior marriages and had discussed it with her on many occasions. I told
him that I had even spoken with her first ex husband on the phone. He seemed
satisfied with that and let me return to my fianc&eacute;e and the interview.</font></p>
  <p>I returned to the other window. Dave had asked how she had left the US.
Olga explained that she left with her first ex husband, Michael, to Hong Kong,
where he was working, and that they were attempting to patch things up and
perhaps remarry. Dave asked how she got back to the Ukraine. Olga explained
that she stayed in Hong Kong for 3 months then her Hong Kong visa expired.
She had to return to the Ukraine. Michael said he would try to get her another
visa but he was unable to. Dave asked for proof that she re-entered the Ukraine.
All Olga had was a photocopy of her Russian passport with a visa stamp for
Hong Kong dated September 27, 1997, 179 days from April 1, 1997 when the
INS made extensive changes to the INA. Dave said that that did not prove
that she entered the Ukraine, it only proved that she left the US. I said
"Does it really matter what the exact date she entered the Ukraine is? I
mean we can see that she was left the US". <br>
  </p>
  <p>Dave seemed like he didn't know exactly what he was doing. I later found 
out that Dave was in training. He would frequently stop the interview and 
go back into the office asking others for advice. He came back and said that 
they needed proof that she entered the Ukraine after leaving the US. He told 
us that things like airplane tickets, voter registration, etc would be acceptable. 
Well Olga didn't keep the used airline ticket stubs. This was almost 4 years 
ago and she didn't think she needed to keep the tickets. Dave said they needed 
to see that she was not barred from the US due to an overstay. Now if Olga 
overstayed more than 180 days she would be barred from re-entry for 3 years. 
Of course, it's clear that Olga has been out of the US for almost 4 years 
(September 1997 - April 2001). But Dave also said that they would not accept 
the photocopied last page of a Russian passport as adequet proof.</p>
  <p>We left the embassy with the green refusal notice stating that we needed 
to gather additional documentation. Later at the hotel we called her mother 
in Mironovka and asked if she could go to the police department and get Olga's 
"registration". It seems if you live in the Ukraine you must register with 
the police stating that you live here. Now Olga returned to her mothers in 
December 1997 and expected that Michael would be able to get her a visa again. 
So she didn't register until around February. Olga's mom faxed us the registration 
but it was a bad fax of a small, hand written registration. </p>
  <h3>Second Interview<br>
  </h3>
  <p>Nonetheless this is all we could muster as proof so we went back the 
next day to the embassy and presented it.</p>
  <p>Again we got Dave. He took this registration and consulted with a person 
who understood Russian as it was written in Russian. After much delays and 
waiting standing at the window (and nervousness) this Ukrainian consular would
not accept this fax stating that the handwritting was too small for him to
read and he disputed some of the dates. So once again we were sent back for
more documentation.</p>
  <p>Back at the hotel we contemplated what could we do to get better proof. 
We called her mom again and asked if she could ask the police to type up the
registration in larger type and fax it again which she did. I also called 
Michael in the US and asked him for help. Michael had drawn up a statement 
saying he indeed did take Olga out of the country, had the statement notarized 
and faxed it to us along with a photocopy of both the first and last pages 
of Olga's old passport. By the way, Olga's old Russian passport was confiscated 
when she returned to the Ukraine and eventually renewed it. Since the Soviet 
Union had broken up years before she was given a Ukrainian passport and her 
Russian passport was not returned to her.</p>
  <h3>Third Interview<br>
  </h3>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">We returned again to the embassy 
with this new evidence. We had a better copy of the registration as well as
Michael's statement. Also the photocopy of the first page of Olga's Russian 
passport had her picture and although it was hard to see the picture the passport
number on the first page matched the passport number on the last page which
had her Hong Kong visa stamp. Dave took this all in and after consulting
with members in the back office announced to us that we met the burden of
prove with respect the issue of re-entering the Ukraine.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Then John came back and Dave 
and John were discussing her exit from the U.S. in 1997. With four of us there
together there started to be a little confusion. John was now pressing on
my fianc&eacute;e again in an authoritative and threatening manner. He was
all confused about the sequence of events. John thought that Olga married 
Jon Miller briefly then divorced him and then left the US with Jon Miller 
to go to Hong Kong. I attempted to interrupt and explain to him what he was
 misinterpreting. He turned to me and like a dog owner barked at me in a
harsh  tone and instructed me to go sit down. After a few minutes he motioned
for  me to return only to explain to me that he was overruling the interviewer
 and sending this petition back for administrative review to the INS office 
in Vienna. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Now I understand and appreciate 
that it is the consular's job to weed out undesirable applicants. However 
I do not feel, as an American citizen, that I need to be threatened, intimidated 
and told that my choice of a spouse is wrong by members of my own government! 
Further it seems to me the supervisor, John, had clearly expressed his bias 
towards my fianc&eacute;e in the first 5  minutes of the interview way before 
making any objective decisions. And I do not appreciate having to suffer for
somebody else's prejudices!</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">I asked John what do I do. 
He said that I could call back to the embassy in 1 or 2 weeks and they would 
give me a tracking number that I could track the case with. I asked him, realistically,
what chance do I have. He told me 50/50.<br>
  </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Devastated with left the embassy 
to contemplate our next move. I had to make all kinds of arrangements with 
the hotel, extending our stay and with the airlines. I flew Olga back to the
Ukraine and I flew back home to California.<br>
  </font></p>
  <h2>Returning home - contacting the embassy</h2>
 Shortly after I returned I called the embassy asking for a tracking number. 
Calling Warsaw is difficult given the time zone difference and considering 
you have only a few hours of the day when they will accept calls. It ends 
up like 2 Am - 4 Am California time. I finally managed to get through and 
asked for the tracking number. The people there were noticibly confused and 
disorganized. <br>
  <br>
 I had spend the two weeks looking up on the Internet about the INS, INA
and looking for any information I could find regarding returned petitions.
I contacted William Livinston, the immigration attorney I used to file the 
K1 and he washed his hands clean stating he was only hired to get me an approval 
and I got an approval! Gee thanks Bill! The conclusion I came to was that 
I needed to understand the exact reason why my petition was returned. Warsaw 
was not telling me.<br>
  <br>
 At this point I started emailing the embassy (A: Andrew DeFaria; W: Warsaw):<br>
