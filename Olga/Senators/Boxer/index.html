  <small>Dear </small><small>Mr Vizoainc</small><small>,</small><br>
  <br>
<small>I was disturbed to receive your letter dated February 7, 2002. Apparently
you still have not understood the issues at hand here. I am getting tired
with this going back and forth only to not have my issues and questions adequately
addressed. Please endeavor to pay attention to the questions and issues I
detail in this fax and answer them directly and completely. It will save
both of us time and headaches.<br>
<br>
First of all I did not request the embassy to return my petition to the Office
of Ombudsman. Quite to the contrary I wished my petition and accompanying
visa application for my fianc&eacute;e to be processed and for me to have
her here with me. It was the embassy that decided to send the petition back.
All I'm requesting is that they process the returned petition, this petition
that they (INS or Department of State) messed up - not I - within a reasonable
amount of time. For the record I do not think that 3 years is a reasonable
amount of time in anybody's estimation.<br>
<br>
Secondly, the INS surely hasn't discussed with me all available information
regarding my case with me. For example, we have this dandy little question
right here (reproduced from a previous fax that your office conveniently
neglected to answer) that <b>HAS NOT BE ANSWERED NOW FOR 10 MONTHS!!!</b>
.<br>
</small>
<blockquote><small>  Finally, as is apparently common, and for reasons that
are totally beyond  me, consistently the questions that I ask are not answered
thoroughly at all. I specifically asked what date did the California Service
Center receive my petition back from the consulate. Why does everybody conveniently
forget to answer that question? The date that they received the petition
back is very important and I have specifically asked for that date and yet
you neglect  to answer that question! Why? As such I will, yet again ask
it:</small><br>
  <br>
  <small><b>QUESTION: WHAT WAS THE DATE THAT THE CALIFORNIA SERVICE CENTER
RECEIVED  MY PETITION?</b></small><br>
  <br>
  <small>   OK, now is there any way I can make myself clearer on that question?</small><br>
  </blockquote>
  <small>I've asked this question of your office several times now and your
office has not addressed it. I will therefore continue to ask this question
until I get a satisfactory answer. This is a reasonable question and it is
reasonable to expect a reasonable answer for it. As such expect it to be
continually asked until answered.<br>
  <br>
Thirdly, to the best of my knowledge, my petition has </small><small><b>NOT
  </b>been revoked at all. No, the consular officer at the Warsaw embassy
has refused to issue a <u>visa</u> my fianc&eacute;e's <u>Visa Application</u>
. Of course, as a competent professional well versed in matters such as these
no doubt you are fully aware of this. If you have specific knowledge that
my petition has indeed been revoked then please state so, in plain English
so as to verify this, in writing so that I may be able to start my appeal.
Because as we both know I have but 30 days to do so, assuming my petition
has really be revoked.</small><br>
  <br>
  <small>Fourthly, I have been in contact with the Department of State Visa
Services Unit many times. In order words I've been there and done that already.
They do not say that my petition was revoked. They do not give me any details
about the revocation of my petition. As far as they are concerned the ball
is in the INS' court and they will not give out any details about my case.</small>
 <small>In fact, in a previous fax to your office I had pleaded for you to
contact the Department of State to obtain those details for me precisely
because I have contacted them and they refuse to give me the details. Is
that not what your office is supposed to do for me?!? So then, consider this
again to be a request for your office to contact the Department of State
Visa Service to get the particulars, the real details for me because they,
a government agency, are refusing to give me this information and I am, again,
requesting your assistance in these matters.</small><br>
