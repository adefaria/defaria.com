 <small>Dear&nbsp;</small><small>Senator Barbara Boxer</small><small>  ,</small><br>
 <small><br>
 </small><small>I received your response the other day. Thanks. All I can
say is that I am totally stunned by it. <b>3 YEARS!!!</b> Surely they can't
be serious! I find it totally unacceptable that I am being punished and forced
 to wait for 3+ years just to get my paperwork processed! This is inhuman!
 They say that consular returns are low priority for them. What exactly does
 that mean? What is it but an excuse for them to take even more time? Why
should consular returns be any lower of a priority than anything else? The
assumption is that either the petitioner or the beneficiary has done something
wrong. Well what if the mistake was not with either the petitioner or the
beneficiary? Indeed the mere fact that the petition was returned indicates
 that the consulate believes that the INS did something wrong! And if my
petition  were looked at I'm sure that they will find that there is nothing
wrong at  all!<br>
 <br>
 <b>QUESTION:</b> Do you believe that a 3 year wait is acceptable or not?<br>
 <br>
   I'm sure you're aware of the LIFE act and the new K3 petitions. Why did
 they come into existence? They came in to existence because Congress realized 
 that the INS was taking in excess of 2 years to process spousal visas and 
 in the interest of family unity they came up with the K3 visa which allows 
 the spouse to reunite with the family and wait out the excessive processing 
 times here in the US. In other words Congress gave relief from what they 
saw as excessive INS processing times. And these were only 2 year waits. Yet
here I'm being told of a 3 year wait. <br>
 <br>
 <b>QUESTION:</b> Why must I be forced to wait for 3 years just to process
 my petition?<br>
 <br>
 <b>QUESTION: </b>Will I be afforded any relief from this excessive wait
time? </small><small><br>
 <br>
   I am <b>NOT </b>asking to be processed before anybody else. On the contrary 
 I believe that my petition, <u>as well as any other petition that has been 
similarly  returned</u><u>,</u> be processed within a <b>reasonable </b>amount 
of time.  What is a reasonable amount of time? I would say no more than 2 
months. That  is more than enough time to process a petition. I am <b>NOT</b>
  asking to  be given special treatment or to be somehow pre approved. On 
the contrary I am asking to have my petition processed on its own merits because
I feel confident that there is nothing wrong going on here. I would expect
expedited service when my petition is reapproved since I was unduly delayed
causing me and my family much unnecessary pain. I find it totally unacceptable
to be told that I have to wait 3 years for my petition to be processed and
kept in the dark as to what the "charges" are against me. Make no mistake
about it I am indeed suffering through this. I effectively have been just
handed a 3 year sentence of continued suffering without knowing why, without
benefit  of due process and without trial. There is no way that this can
be right,  just or moral.<br>
 <br>
   What I'd like to know is what is your office going to do for me? How will 
 they assist me in this matter? Because so far it seems like they have likewise 
 convicted me and seem to have no problems with letting their constituate 
suffer for another 3 years in the dark.<br>
 <br>
 <b>QUESTION: </b>What will your office do to assist me in this matter?<br>
<br>
 Finally, as is apparently common, and for reasons that are totally beyond
 me, consistently the questions that I ask are not answered thoroughly at
all. I specifically asked what date did the California Service Center receive
my petition back from the consulate. Why does everybody conveniently forget
to answer that question? The date that they received the petition back is
very important and I have specifically asked for that date and yet you neglect
 to answer that question! Why? As such I will, yet again ask it:<br>
 <br>
 <b>QUESTION: WHAT WAS THE DATE THAT THE CALIFORNIA SERVICE CENTER RECEIVED
 MY PETITION?<br>
 </b><br>
  OK, now is there any way I can make myself clearer on that question?<br>
<br>
</small><small>Also, the processing times are consistently getting longer
and longer. Initially I was told 6 months, then 1 year, then 18 months. In
fact, as recently as January 7, 2002 a representative of your office, Gabrielle,
told me 18 months. Then I hear 2 years and then 2 years and 6 months. Now
3 years. I think it more than mere coincidence that the estimates keep going
up by 6 months. Also what I find hard to believe is that the time keeps getting
longer! I mean I've already waited approximately 9 months. The time should
be getting shorter not longer! And these estimates are estimates from what
start date? Logic suggests from the date the petition was returned to the
California Service Center. So hopefully you can see why I believe that date
to be particularly important to me. Please include that date with your response,
OK?</small><br>
<small><br>
 <b>Note:</b> The questions above denoted with the word <b>QUESTION</b> are 
 <b>NOT</b> rhetorical! I am requesting an answer for them specifically.<br>
