             <br>
         <small>Dear&nbsp;</small><small>Senator Barbara Boxer</small><small>
,</small><br>
    <br>
    <small>Let me be clear as to what assistance I am seeking from your office.
I am seeking to obtain answers to the following questions:<br>
    <br>
    </small>    
<ol>
      <li><small>The date that the California Service Center received my
petition</small><small><br>
        </small></li>
      <li><small>Whether a new case number or file number has been assigned 
 to my case or should I continue to identify my case by the above identifiers.</small></li>
      <li><small>A definitive statement of what the problem is with my petition</small></li>
      <li><small>The current status of my petition; if under investigation
 then  the current status of the investigation</small></li>
      <li><small>A reasonable estimate of when a decision will be reached</small></li>
      <li><small>Whether I will be permitted to introduce any evidence or 
additional  information to support my case and if so how and where&nbsp;</small></li>
       
</ol>
    <small>As for #1 above, I've been given extremely rough estimates of
how   long this process takes. I assume that these time estimates start when
the   service center receives the petition back. As such the date the service
center  received the petition is important.</small><small><br>
    </small><small><br>
    </small><small>As for #3, I had received a statement  from  the Warsaw
consulate that vaguely mentioned what </small><small><i>  might</i></small><small>
   be the problem. I have also heard from INS people  that the problem is
probably  that they are investigating my fianc&eacute;e's  prior marriages
to US Citizen's  as possibly being fraudulent. But to date  I have never
received anything official stating that indeed my problem was  that. I would
like an official statement stating exactly what the problem  is. I do not
think that this is too much to ask for.</small><small><br>
    </small><small><br>
    </small><small>Regarding #4 above, I would like to know what status my
 petition  is in as well as some indication of what steps are ahead. I have
 no foreknowledge  of the steps and procedures that the INS takes in these
 matters. I am trying  to understand this process, where I am in this process,
 what's next and what  other steps lie ahead. Again I do not think that this
 is too much to ask for.</small><small><br>
    </small><small><br>
    </small><small>I think I deserve a reasonable estimate as to when a decision
  will be made in my case. From what I've been able to ascertain so far my
 petition arrived in the service center sometime in the early summer of 2001.
 From that time until now, as far as I can tell, it has just sat there! Sitting
  there with absolutely nothing being done to it, not even notifying me,
that the petition has arrived back to the service center is simply  unacceptable. 
Also, as far as I can tell, nothing will be done with my petition  unless 
somebody like you inquires about my petition, it's status and asks  when it
will be processed. I've contacted the INS many times. And many times  they
told me that they had no plans on doing </small><small><b>anything</b></small><small>
     with my petition. They were of the opinion that they already done all
 that  they will do with my petition. This too is unacceptable. I need your
 assistance  to get the INS to work on my petition because, again, they have
 told me that  they will not work on it.</small><small><br>
    </small><small><br>
    </small><small>I also feel that I should be allowed the opportunity to
 present  evidence and/or additional information to support my case. I was
 told, on  a number of occasions by the Warsaw Embassy that I can submit
additional  evidence however I was never told how I can do that nor where
I should submit  the evidence. Can I or can I not submit evidence to support
my case? If I  cannot then why did the embassy tell me, several times mind
you, that I could?</small><br>
    <br>
 <small>I find it disturbing that your office treats me as if my  fianc&eacute;e 
and I are guilty as charged and should be forced to wait and  endure much 
hardship and pain. It's as if they believe we are common criminals.  I know 
that I, as a US Citizen, have the right to be seen as innocent until  proven 
guilty. I realize that my fianc&eacute;e, not being a US Citizen does  not 
have that right yet. However I believe that she and I deserve at least  some 
common courtesy and respect that perhaps we are indeed telling the truth,
  that my fianc&eacute;e did not try to commit fraud and that we should get
  to the bottom of this issue observing the facts before making any judgments,
  especially since such prejudgments profoundly effect the life of one of
your constituents. I am asking for my case to be heard, not for my case to
be pushed through the system without scrutiny.</small><small><br>
    </small><small><br>
    </small><small>I do believe that I am being unfairly judged and that
I  was  unfairly treated by the embassy. I have already filed a complaint
about  the  consular who treated me very disrespectfully, intimidating me
and being  downright  rude. I also feel I've been treated with disrespect
by INS officials  too. I would like to be treated with respect from your
office and the people  that  work there.</small><small><br>
    </small><small><br>
    </small><small>And I do believe that my petition should not have been 
returned  by the embassy, that there was not a legal basis for the consular 
to return  the petition. I say so because of the following section from the 
Foreign Affairs Manual (</small><small>9 FAM 42.43 N2.1 Petitions Approved 
in Error): </small>   
<blockquote><small>The approval of a petition is usually considered to be 
 prima facie evidence that the alien beneficiary has met the petition requirements.
  Unless a petition has been approved in error, the petition can only be
returned  if the consular officer knows, or has reason to believe, that the
beneficiary  is not entitled to status. Knowledge and reason to believe must
be based upon evidence that the INS did not have available at the time of
adjudication.  This evidence often arises as a result of or during the consular
officer&#8217;s  interview. </small><b><small><u>Reason to believe must be more
than mere conjecture  or speculation</u></small></b><small>&#8212;there must exist
probability,   </small><b><small><u>  supported by evidence</u></small></b><small>
 that the alien is not entitled to status.</small></blockquote>
     <small> And 9 FAM 42.43 N2.2 Cases of Sham Marriages: </small>     
   
  <blockquote><small>INS has minimum evidentiary standards that must be established
  before revocation proceedings may begin. These minimum evidentiary standards
  are: </small>               
    <p><small>(1) A written statement from one or both of the parties to the
marriage or documentary evidence that money exchanged hands; or </small></p>
                 
    <p><small>(2) </small><b><small><u>Factual evidence developed by the consular
 officer that would convince a reasonable person that the marriage was a
sham  marriage entered into to evade immigration laws.</u></small></b></p>
       </blockquote>
                           
    <p></p>
                  <small>It is clear that the wording of these clauses is 
fairly  strong and that the intention was to stress that the consular officer 
should  not be second guessing the decisions made by the INS unless there 
exists <u><b>factual evidence  developed by the consular officer</b></u> to
indicate otherwise. Further it is  expressly mentioned that <u><b>conjecture 
or speculation</b></u> is not enough to  return a petition, that there must 
be probability <u><b>supported by evidence</b></u>  before the consular should 
consider returning the petition. It seems clear that the INS knows that such 
returned petitions can cause undue hardships and delays. </small><small><br>
       </small><small><br>
       </small><small>And yet I feel strongly that the consular did return
 my petition without sufficient factual evidence. This is why I had tried
so hard to find out what factual evidence they were basing their decision
to return the petition on. You see I was at the interview and I heard what
the consular heard. My petition had clearly disclosed both of my fianc&eacute;e's 
prior marriages, their start and end dates as well as both of her divorce 
decrees. For the  life of me I cannot fathom what new facts the consular thought
arose at the interview that the INS did not have available at the time of
adjudication. There were no new facts. I feel confident when I say that I
believe the consular return the petition based on conjecture and speculation 
that my fianc&eacute;e must have married solely for the purposes of obtaining 
an immigration benefit and if he sent back my petition then surely the INS 
would find something.</small><small><br>
       </small><small><br>
       </small><small>However they will find that they are mistaken because 
 I have already researched this, obtained a Freedom Of Information Act (FIOA) 
 file that clearly shows the record and there is no evidence in the record 
 that my fianc&eacute;e ever even applied for an immigration benefit based 
on her  second marriage (her first marriage was a K1 so obviously they applied 
for  AOS for her first marriage but I feel that the consular was clearly questioning
 her second marriage not her first and I know the first marriage was not
entered into fraudulently either).</small><small><br>
       </small><small><br>
       </small><small>I fail to understand what is so secretive about these 
 new facts that I cannot be made aware of them. This is definitely not a matter
 of national security and there isn't even a hint of a terrorist threat or
anything  like that. Yet the embassy will not tell me what these supposed 
new facts  are and I believe that this is because they don't have any new 
facts and to admit that would be to admit that they did not follow the proper 
procedures.</small><small><br>
       </small><small><br>
       </small><small>While I may not be privileged enough to be told these 
 facts perhaps you and your office can be told what these facts really are. 
If so  then I'm sure that you would see that my petition was erroneously returned
 in violation of the regulations and you might better understand my anger
over being put though this pain for unjust causes. Could you find out these
facts for me, tell me them if you can or keep them to yourselves if you must,
but at least become aware of them so you can see my viewpoint?</small><small><br>
       </small><small><br>
       </small><small>Further, I have already spoken with both of my fianc&eacute;e's 
 ex husband's. Neither of them feel that their marriages were entered into 
 solely for the purpose of frauding the INS for an immigration benefit. My 
 fianc&eacute;e states that the purposes of her marriages were not solely 
for an immigration benefit, the record shows she didn't even apply for a visa
for her second marriage and she even left the country on her own accord in
good terms with the hopes of someday finding her true love and returning to
America. She's found her true love in me. And now we are waiting for my government
to allow her to return. You can help correct this wrong I feel that has been
perpetrated on us.</small><small><br>
