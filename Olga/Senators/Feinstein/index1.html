              <br>
          <small>Dear Senator Diane Feinstein,</small><br>
     <br>
     <font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><small>Thank you for your
voice mail dated January 29, 2002 however I am sorry to say th</small><small>
at I find the answer insufficient. Let me again attempt to be clear as to
what a</small><small>ssistance I am seeking from your office. Feel free to
contact me if you need fur</small><small>ther clarification of any of the
following. I am seeking to obtain answers to th</small><small>e following
questions:</small><small><br>
     </small></font>     
<ol>
       <li><small>The date that the California Service Center received my 
petition. You seem to be reluctant to obtain this information for me. Forgive 
me but your voice mail message was not very clear. It seemed as if you were 
saying that you cannot tell me when the INS received my returned petition 
because they have not entered it into their computer system. Yet you also 
mention that processing of returned petitions can take from 24 - 30 months. 
My question is simple: 24 - 30 months from <b>when?!?</b> In other words how
does one determine a 24 - 30 month time period has ended when one does not
known from what date to start counting from?!? I do not know how I could be
clearer on this issue. If you are still confused then please tell me what 
is confusing you here. It feels like you are intentionally being elusi</small><small>
ve about this issue. Why?</small><br>
   </li>
       <li><small>You stated that the California Service Center is backlogged
several months. How many months is the California Service Center backlogged?
Because I've already been waiting 9 months. In a few more months it'll be
a year! What is going to be done to stop these unnecessary delays?</small></li>
       <li><small>I still do not have a definitive statement of what the
problem is with my petition. You mean to tell me that I'm to be kept separated
from my fiancee for more than 2 years and I will not be told why? How could
this be right? How can this be just? How can you let your constituents suffer
such pain? As a United States Citizen I demand to know why I am being persecuted
for years without a known just cause! This is similar to a Writ of Habeus
Corpus</small></li>
       <li><small>According to Lisa Piascik &lt;PiascikL@state.gov&gt; of
the Visa Services in the state department there is a difference between an
approved petition and an approved visa application. The embassy takes the
visa application and must either issue or refuse the visa. My fianc&eacute;e's
visa was refused. According to Lisa the embassy must issue a written explanation
why they refused the visa ("New facts arose..." doesn't cut it because there
are no new facts! See below). My fianc&eacute;e and I never received the
written explanation. Now I know your office approached the embassy inquiring
on my behalf as to the reasons my petition was returned for administrative
review but only managed to receive a vague response. Now I am asking you
to get this written explanation about why my fianc&eacute;e's visa was refused.</small>
 <small>I want a written explanation from the embassy.</small></li>
         
</ol>
     <small>Following are a few points that remain unanswered from my last
fax. Why do you continue to not answer these?<br>
</small>
<ul>
  <li><small>I would still like to know what status my  petition  is in as
well as some indication of what steps are ahead. I have  no foreknowledge
 of the steps and procedures that the INS takes in these  matters. I am trying
 to understand this process, where I am in this process,  what's next and
what  other steps lie ahead. Again I do not think that this  is too much
to ask for.&nbsp;</small></li>
  <li><small>I also feel that I should be allowed the opportunity to  present
 evidence and/or additional information to support my case. I was  told,
on  a number of occasions by the Warsaw Embassy that I can submit additional
 evidence however I was never told how I can do that nor where I should submit
 the evidence. Can I or can I not submit evidence to support my case? If
I  cannot then why did the embassy tell me, several times mind you, that
I could?</small></li>
</ul>
<small>And although the following is rather lengthy I feel it is still pertinent
and as such I ask you to respond to it again. Make no mistake about it I
will continue to ask these questions and push these issues until they are
addressed. They are important to me and if you were in my shoes I'm sure
you would do likewise. I feel like I have been treated unfairly and I have
been pleading with your office for assistance so that this wrong can be righted.
<br>
<br>
I do believe that I am being unfairly judged and that I  was  unfairly treated
by the embassy. I have already filed a complaint about  the  consular who
treated me very disrespectfully, intimidating me and being  downright  rude.
I also feel I've been treated with disrespect by INS officials  too. I would
like to be treated with respect from your office and the people  that  work
there.</small><small><br>
     </small><small><br>
     </small><small>And I do believe that my petition should not have been
 returned  by the embassy, that there was not a legal basis for the consular
 to return  the petition. I say so because of the following section from
the  Foreign Affairs Manual (</small><small>9 FAM 42.43 N2.1 Petitions Approved
 in Error): </small>    
<blockquote><small>The approval of a petition is usually considered to be
  prima facie evidence that the alien beneficiary has met the petition requirements. 
  Unless a petition has been approved in error, the petition can only be returned
 if the consular officer knows, or has reason to believe, that the beneficiary
 is not entitled to status. Knowledge and reason to believe must be based
upon evidence that the INS did not have available at the time of adjudication.
 This evidence often arises as a result of or during the consular officer&#8217;s
 interview. </small><b><small><u>Reason to believe must be more than mere
conjecture  or speculation</u></small></b><small>&#8212;there must exist probability,
  </small><b><small><u>  supported by evidence</u></small></b><small>  that
the alien is not entitled to status.</small></blockquote>
      <small> And 9 FAM 42.43 N2.2 Cases of Sham Marriages: </small>    
       
  <blockquote><small>INS has minimum evidentiary standards that must be established 
  before revocation proceedings may begin. These minimum evidentiary standards 
  are: </small>                    
    <p><small>(1) A written statement from one or both of the parties to
the marriage or documentary evidence that money exchanged hands; or </small></p>
                       
    <p><small>(2) </small><b><small><u>Factual evidence developed by the
consular  officer that would convince a reasonable person that the marriage
was a sham  marriage entered into to evade immigration laws.</u></small></b></p>
        </blockquote>
                                 
    <p></p>
                   <small>It is clear that the wording of these clauses is
 fairly  strong and that the intention was to stress that the consular officer
 should  not be second guessing the decisions made by the INS unless there
 exists <u><b>factual evidence  developed by the consular officer</b></u>
 to indicate otherwise. Further it is  expressly mentioned that <u><b>conjecture
 or speculation</b></u> is not enough to  return a petition, that there must
 be probability <u><b>supported by evidence</b></u>  before the consular
should  consider returning the petition. It seems clear that the INS knows
that such  returned petitions can cause undue hardships and delays. </small><small><br>
        </small><small><br>
        </small><small>And yet I feel strongly that the consular did return 
 my petition without sufficient factual evidence. This is why I had tried 
so hard to find out what factual evidence they were basing their decision 
to return the petition on. You see I was at the interview and I heard what 
the consular heard. My petition had clearly disclosed both of my fianc&eacute;e's
 prior marriages, their start and end dates as well as both of her divorce
 decrees. For the  life of me I cannot fathom what new facts the consular
thought arose at the interview that the INS did not have available at the
time of adjudication. There were no new facts. I feel confident when I say
that I believe the consular return the petition based on conjecture and speculation
 that my fianc&eacute;e must have married solely for the purposes of obtaining
 an immigration benefit and if he sent back my petition then surely the INS
 would find something.</small><small><br>
        </small><small><br>
        </small><small>However they will find that they are mistaken because
  I have already researched this, obtained a Freedom Of Information Act (FIOA)
  file that clearly shows the record and there is no evidence in the record
  that my fianc&eacute;e ever even applied for an immigration benefit based
 on her  second marriage (her first marriage was a K1 so obviously they applied
 for  AOS for her first marriage but I feel that the consular was clearly
questioning  her second marriage not her first and I know the first marriage
was not entered into fraudulently either).</small><small><br>
        </small><small><br>
        </small><small>I fail to understand what is so secretive about these
  new facts that I cannot be made aware of them. This is definitely not a
matter  of national security and there isn't even a hint of a terrorist threat
or anything  like that. Yet the embassy will not tell me what these supposed
 new facts  are and I believe that this is because they don't have any new
 facts and to admit that would be to admit that they did not follow the proper
 procedures.</small><small><br>
        </small><small><br>
        </small><small>While I may not be privileged enough to be told these
  facts perhaps you and your office can be told what these facts really are.
 If so  then I'm sure that you would see that my petition was erroneously
returned  in violation of the regulations and you might better understand
my anger over being put though this pain for unjust causes. Could you find
out these facts for me, tell me them if you can or keep them to yourselves
if you must, but at least become aware of them so you can see my viewpoint?</small><small><br>
        </small><small><br>
        </small><small>Further, I have already spoken with both of my fianc&eacute;e's
  ex husband's. Neither of them feel that their marriages were entered into
  solely for the purpose of frauding the INS for an immigration benefit.
My   fianc&eacute;e states that the purposes of her marriages were not solely
 for an immigration benefit, the record shows she didn't even apply for a
visa for her second marriage and she even left the country on her own accord
in good terms with the hopes of someday finding her true love and returning
to America. She's found her true love in me. And now we are waiting for my
government to allow her to return. You can help correct this wrong I feel
that has been perpetrated on us.</small><small><br>
