  </font></small><small><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Dear Sirs,</font></small><small><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><br>
  </font></small><small><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><br>
  </font></small><small><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">I wish
to file a formal complaint against a consular officer in the Warsaw Embassy 
in Poland. Unfortunately I do not have the name of this officer despite repeated 
attempts to contact the embassy and obtain his name. I've been trying to get
his name for approximately 4 months now and they simply refuse to give me
that information. What I can say is that he was a relatively tall with short
blonde hair and appeared to be one of the two American officers working at
the windows there. He described his self as the supervisor. The other American
consular there was in training at the time.</font></small><small><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><br>
  </font></small><small><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><br>
  </font></small><small><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Here is 
my the story that explains why I fell compelled to report this consular as 
abusive and as having shown a prejudice against me and my fianc&eacute;e. 
This prejudice is causing me extreme emotional pain as I have been forced 
into a very lengthy and frustrating battle with the Immigration and Naturalization 
Service and may even be faced with never being able to bring my fianc&eacute;e 
here to America to live with me. I realize that filing this complaint will 
not help my case with the INS however I feel that as an American I must register 
my grievances so that future Americans will hopefully not need to experience 
this abuse and prejudice.</font></small><small><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><br>
  </font></small><small><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><br>
  </font></small><small><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">My fianc&eacute;e, 
Olga Fedoryaka, and I were scheduled for an interview at the Warsaw Embassy 
on April 23, 2001 so that she could obtain a Fianc&eacute;e Visa. Shortly 
after  my fianc&eacute;e's interview started this blonde haired consular pulled
me aside to another window and asked me why I wanted my fianc&eacute;e. I
was not aware that it is customary to interview the petitioner at such visa
interviews! I told him that I loved her and wanted to bring her to America 
to be my wife. He then asked if I was aware that my fianc&eacute;e was in 
the U.S. before. I responded that she had not been deported. He looked at 
me very sternly and menacingly, raised his voice and scolded me "Now don't 
be trying to get legal with me!". I told him I was not trying to get legal 
with him I was just trying to inform him that she was not deported and apologized. 
Needless to say at this point I was very nervous and intimidated. I did not 
feel that I needed to be scolded by him nor intimidated by him however I was
worried if I didn't go along with whatever he said that he would deny my
petition. In other words I felt very threatened by him. </font></small><small>
  </small> 
<p><small><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Next he asked me if I 
knew that she had been married twice before and that he believed that she 
was just using me to get a ticket to America. I told him that I was fully 
aware of her prior marriages and had discussed it with her on many occasions. 
I told him that I had even spoken with her first ex husband on the phone. 
He seemed satisfied with that and let me return to my fianc&eacute;e and the
interview.  </font></small></p>
 <small> </small> 
<p><small><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Later on in the interview 
my fianc&eacute;e and the other consular interviewer were discussing her exit
from the U.S. in 1997. The blonde supervisor stopped by and joined in the
discussion. With four of us there together there started to be a little confusion.
The blonde supervisor was now pressing on my fianc&eacute;e again in an authoritative
and threatening manner. He was all confused about the sequence of events.
I attempted to interrupt and explain to him what he was misinterpreting.
He turned to me and like a dog owner barked at me in a harsh tone and instructed
me to go sit down. After a few minutes he motioned for me to return only
to explain to me that he was overruling the interviewer and sending this
petition back for administrative review. </font></small></p>
 <small> </small> 
<p><small><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Now I understand and appreciate
that it is the consular's job to weed out undesirable applicants. However
I do not feel, as an American citizen, that I need to be threatened, intimidated
and told that my choice of a spouse is wrong by members of my own government!
Further it seems to me that this blonde haired supervisor had clearly expressed
his bias towards my fianc&eacute;e in the first 5  minutes of the interview
way before making any objective decisions. And I do not appreciate having
to suffer for somebody else's prejudices!</font></small></p>
 <small> </small> 
<p><small><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">In my latest attempt to
ascertain this consular's name another employee of the Embassy emailed me.
Normally they do not identify themselves however this time they did. &nbsp;It
was signed Maria Rudensky Silver, Chief Immigrant Visa Section. I had emailed
Ms. Silver back inquiring again for that blonde haired consulars name. As
expected she has not responded. I therefore feel compelled to also file a
formal complaint against Ms Silver for refusing to provide me this man's
name.</font></small><small><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><br>
  </font></small><small> </small></p>
 <small> </small> 
<p><small><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Please do whatever is 
required to file an official complaint against both Ms. Silver and this blonde 
haired supervisor consular. I want it to be known and logged. I also would 
like to have confirmation that my complaints were indeed registered. If you 
need any further assistance from me to do this then feel free to contact me.</font></small><small><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><br>
  </font></small></p>
 <small> </small> 
<p><small><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">I await your response. 
</font></small></p>
 <small> </small> 
<p><small><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Sincerely</font></small></p>
