 <small><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Dear Sirs,</font></small>
 
<p><small><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Recently I finally received 
the OF-194 form. Thank you. I wish I could say it was helpful but it is not. 
Missing is, of course, the important information and that would be WHY the 
case requires an administrative review!</font></small></p>
 
<p><small><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">At the bottom of the page
were these foreboding words:<br>
 </font></small></p>
 
<blockquote><b>*WARNING: IF YOU FAIL TO TAKE THE ACTION REQUESTED WITHIN ONE
YEAR FOLLOWING VISA DENIAL UNDER SECTION 221(G) OF THE IMMIGRATION AND NATIONALITY
ACT, SECTION 203(G)</b> <b>OF THE ACT REQUIRES THAT YOUR APPLICATION BE CANCELLED.<br>
   </b></blockquote>
   <small>As we approach the one year anniversary I would like to emphatically 
state that </small><small><b>I DO NOT WANT MY APPLICATION TO BE CANCELLED!!!</b></small><small>
  I've been trying, by all means at my disposal, to get my petition processed 
by the INS including, but not limited to, calling, writing letters, 4 different 
immigration attorneys, enlisting the help of my Congressional representative 
and both of my Senators as well as driven down to Laguna Niguel to attempt 
to speak to somebody in person. Nothing has been effective in getting the 
INS to review my petition! I would also like to bring to your attention that 
there is no "action" requested on the OF-194 form that I have any control 
over. The action is for a third party, the INS, and it is beyond my control 
to compel them to act.</small><small><br>
   </small><small><br>
   </small><small>Section 203(G) of the INA is sufficiently vague with respect 
to this:</small><small><br>
   </small>   
  <blockquote><small><span style="font-family: arial; "><span style="font-size: 15px; ">
  (g) Lists.- For purposes of carrying out the Secretary's  responsibilities
 in the orderly administration of this  section, the Secretary of State may
 make reasonable estimates  of the anticipated numbers of visas to be issued
 during any  quarter of any fiscal year within each of the categories  under
 subsections (a), (b), and (c) and to rely upon such  estimates in authorizing
 the issuance of visas. The Secretary  of State shall terminate the registration
 of any alien who  fails to apply for an immigrant visa within one year 
following  notification to the alien of the availability of  such visa, but
the Secretary  shall reinstate the registration  of any such alien who establishes
within  2 years following  the date of notification of the availability of
such visa   that such failure to apply was due to circumstances beyond  the
alien's control.</span></span></small><small>  </small><small><br>
     </small></blockquote>
     <small>The only part that appears to be relevant to a one year deadline 
is last sentence which explicitly mentions "availability of such visa". This 
is confusing? Is a visa available for my fianc&eacute;e or not? If so then 
give it to us so I can bring her here. If not then how does this section apply.<br>
     <br>
 The other portion that seems relevant is "failure to apply was due to circumstances 
beyond the alien's control". Seems to me that circumstances are not only beyond
my control (the US citizen) it is also beyond her control (a Ukrainian citizen).
    <br>
     <br>
 I'm just really concerned that if we do not do the proper thing by the one 
year anniversary that my petition will be canceled causing yet further delay 
in the process. Please contact me letting me know if there is anything that 
I need to do to prevent this. Email would be quick and ideal. Respond to me
if I need to do anything. Also respond to me if I don't need to do anything 
and things are OK. Either way respond to me. It is important. Otherwise I 
do not know the answer and it will cause me further unnecessary and unneeded 
worry.</small>&nbsp;
