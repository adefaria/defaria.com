<p>BTW Professional is what you do and how you act, not the words you choose to use. Your unprofessional behavior is clear by all of the negative comments shown above. I am not unprofessional by saying fuck when you start by being unprofessional in your actions! IOW once you behave unprofessional with me then my responsibility to be profession with you is over.</p>

<p>Here's what I should have done... from <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/steve-lukather-leaf-blowers/">Steve Lukather Battles Leaf Blowers</a></p>
