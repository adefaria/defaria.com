<h2>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Automatic versus Manual</font></h2>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>Having an automatic transmission
can sometimes be a burden. Sports car enthusiasts, including other Corvette
drivers, will shun on you for getting the slush box over the stick. People
have automatics for many reasons, some of which are convenience, cost,
availability, and driver skill level. It is not easy to drive a manual
transmission fast. Not just anybody can hop into a six speed and make it
faster than the auto. In fact, I would be willing to wager that most six-speed
drivers out there can be beaten stop light to stop light by most auto drivers.
It is a fine art and takes much practice to master driving a manual transmission
efficiently. It can be done though and, in identical cars with perfect
drivers, the manual transmission will be faster than the automatic in every
circumstance. Do you drive an automatic? How would you like to turn this
around so that your car is faster and quicker than every six speed out
there? We can turn our weaknesses into strengths and leave every six speed
in the dust. Not to mention this will also make your automatic much, much
quicker and I can not think of a better bang for the buck.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>Six speed transmissions are
faster for one reason: they rob less horsepower from your engine. Manual
transmissions have parts that positively mesh and interlock such as dry
clutches and gear teeth while automatics replace these parts with fluid
driven hydraulic torque converters and wet clutch packs. You are just going
to get more power to the rear wheels with a stick and there is nothing
you can do to reverse this.</font></font>
<h2>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Improving the Performance of You Automatic
Transmission</font></h2>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>What we can do already is to
make the transmission work better with the engine and allow the automatic
transmission to start working when the engine reaches its power band. This
is done with a looser stall converter. I could write paragraphs and paragraphs
trying to explain converters to you but the truth is they still remain
somewhat shrouded in mystery to me. The company who built my converter,
<a href="http://www.protorque.com">ProTorque</a>
(<a href="http://www.protorque.com">http://www.protorque.com</a>), also
has a tremendously informative site up with lots of facts. There is no
greater HP value than the stall converter in the land of hot-rodding. I
chose a 2900 rpm stall converter and it was $650 delivered from <a href="http://www.proautotech.com">Pro
Auto Tech</a> (<a href="http://www.proautotech.com">http://www.proautotech.com</a>).
The claim is &frac12; second better time in the quarter mile. No other
upgrade can compete with this for the money.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>In a nutshell, the after
market torque converter is more efficient and takes less power to operate
which means more power to the rear wheels. Its primary strength however
is that it doesn't begin to transmit power to the transmission until the
engine is in its power band. An engine revs faster and more easily in neutral.
Imagine revving a motor up to 2500 rpm or so in neutral and then dropping
the shifter into drive.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>Wouldn't this method leave
quicker than just flooring it while in gear? Of course you wouldn't do
this because it can damage the transmission and you have to wait for the
gears to engage using this method anyway which takes time. The looser stall
converter can simulate this while you are in drive already by not transmitting
power, when the gas pedal is floored, until the engine comes up within
its strong area.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>Why donut the car companies
do this to begin with? Well, there are issues with driveability and fuel
mileage. I will cover all driveability issues later in this article and
fuel mileage is iffy. Newer cars have computers that can physically lock
up the torque converter. This is desirable when full engine power is being
delivered to the transmission so the converter stops depending on fluid
to turn itself but has real time positive mechanical lock up. This is much
more efficient than fluid driving the car.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>I put a 2900 rpm converter
on my car which means that the converter will not lock up until the engine
reaches 2900 rpm. So, my car is being driven by fluid until it hits that
engine speed. But, do you drive on the highway at 2900 rpm? I hope not,
you would be going well within ticket range. So, if my torque converter
is not locking up at freeway speeds and my rear wheels are being driven
by transmission fluid isn't that less efficient and wont my mileage be
terrible?</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>This is the concern but we
live in the end of the twentieth century and enjoy computers and their
benefits in every aspect of our lives including automobiles. Your computer
knows that you are traveling at freeway speeds regardless of RPM and tells
your transmission to lock up that converter for positive power delivery
from engine to transmission with no loss. Problem solved.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>There are still some very
real concerns about around town driveability with a higher speed stall,
which I will discuss at the end of this piece.</font></font>
<h2>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Shift Kits</font></h2>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>Next modification in the drive
line is the shift kit. This kind of gets me in a tizzy because I made a
mistake. I ignorantly confused shift speed with shift firmness and permanently
installed the wrong part in my car. The part I am talking about is the
B&amp;M Shift Plus computer shift firmness selector. The <a href="http://www.hypertech-inc.com/main.html">Hypertech
Power Programmer</a> (<a href="http://www.hypertech-inc.com/main.html">http://www.hypertech-inc.com/main.html</a>)
shift firmness section does the same thing.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>Shift firmness is internal
transmission line pressure and that's what these devices control too. They
can firm up the shifts, but not speed them up. My question is why bother?
The PCM gives you maximum shift firmness at wide open throttle (WOT) anyway
which is really the only time you need the boost. These devices fool the
transmission into thinking you are at WOT no matter what speed you are
at and thus give full firmness at lower speeds. This means nothing and
doesn't help performance. It merely makes your butt feel like your car
is going quicker at lower speeds than it really is. Useless for performance,
donut waste your money if that is what you are going for.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>What you <b>want</b> to do
is to speed up your shifts. When a transmission shifts gears it remains
in two gears at once for a short time to give smoothness to the shifts.
This has two downsides though, it increases wear and slows you down. The
only way to speed up your shifts is to add a real shift kit. This involves
removing the transmission pan and the valve body to install new springs,
balls, gaskets, plates, etc. This is the only way to go if you want to
beef your transmission up for better performance. The only company I would
think of getting a shift kit from is TransGo. They are the best and I have
never seen a reason to switch brands.&nbsp; I got the TransGo shift kit
for my year (94-99) and it cost me $130. This is a great thing to do to
any automatic regardless of other modifications. You will experience crisper
shifts, lower transmission temperatures, and a faster car.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>Automatic transmissions on
the C5 are stifled with two gear choices. One is so lame that it doesn't
belong on your Granny's Buick and the other is barely adequate. The two
gear ratios in order of descending suckiness are 2.73 and 3.15&nbsp; If
you have the 3.15 this upgrade may not be worth the money since that ratio
is almost getting within respectable gearing. But if you have the 2.73
in your car like I do please read the following section closely because
this final drive ratio is not good for anything other than saving gas.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>The six speed cars have a
ratio of 3.42, which is OK but still not what I like. I would prefer a
3.73 in an automatic and the 4.11 in the six speed.&nbsp; Unfortunately,
the best ratio available (Even though this is a higher number it is considered
a lower gear.) is the lower 3.42. This will make a big, big difference
over the 2.73 gear but may not be worth the money for you performance axles
owners.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>Unlike the C4 Corvette, the
C5 uses identical rear&nbsp; differentials, or carriers, for both the manual
and automatic transmissions. This means you can just bolt up the whole
factory loaded six speed carrier to your automatic transmission and get
instant performance. Gains to expect? On my 94 I went from stock converter
and performance axle to 2400 stall speed converter and 3.73 gears and got
.8 seconds faster in the quarter.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>On this car I am doing taller
3.42 gears but a higher stall speed of 2900 rpm so I hope to get similar
gains. This would make it easily a 12 second car and who knows with good
tires. This kind of speed does not come cheap.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>Buying the carrier? I called
every after market tuner there was and these things were just too expensive.
Then I called the Chevy dealer direct and told them I had a business license
and wished to buy a part at wholesale. I told them what I wanted and got
20% off list. My cost was $800!!! Nearly half of what the after market
guys wanted.&nbsp; This is a tremendous value.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>You will need something to
recalibrate the speedometer though. I suggest picking up the Hypertech
Power Programmer for $300 since it can let you reprogram for the lower
gear ratio.</font></font>
<h2>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Fluids</font></h2>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>We are almost done with the
parts here but I want to talk a bit about fluids, lubrication, and cooling.
I am going to sum this up quickly, Redline makes the best lubricants as
far as I am concerned. They have a great history in racing and their dyno
reports show power gains with their products. I am using Redline D4 synthetic
ATF in the transmission and 75/90 synthetic in the differential. I also
use Redline 5w-30 synthetic in my engine. I also added a fluid made by
Fluid-Gard called ATF Enhancer which, beyond many other claims, reportedly
lowers transmission temperatures. I have heard some third party endorsements
that did observe ten degree drops in operating temperatures. The higher
speed stall&nbsp; converter can cause higher temps to occur which is why
this is important. I also added a large, dedicated transmission cooler
to my car. It looks like a little radiator and is mounted in front of the
radiator up front. Between the cooler and the Fluid-Gard my ATF temperatures
should well within safe range.</font></font>
<h2>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Installation</font></h2>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>Now we are ready to discuss
the install, or lack there of. I hashed it over and over in my head if
I should put these parts in myself. I have a pretty solid automotive technician
background and I know I could put them in the thing is I just didn't really
want to put them in.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>After thinking it over I
realized that I would be better served finding an experienced guy to put
the parts in for me. My search was on.&nbsp; I looked high and low within
an 800 mile radius of my home to find a seasoned person. In the end the
guy for me was less than an hour from my home. His name is Paul and he
works for Roy Robinson Chevrolet. His love for cars, technical repair,
and Corvettes really shines when you talk to him. He begged me to bring
the parts in the Friday before I dropped the car off so he could look them
over and read all the literature over the weekend, <b>on his time!!</b>
That was great and really showed he was dedicated to doing a good job.
He has C5 Corvette experience and is the main transmission guy for this
dealership. I really liked him and trusted him right off the bat. This
doesn't happen to me all that often so I took it as a signal to go with
him.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>Also, they gave me a firm,
reasonable estimate of ~$900 total labor. No other place would even talk
estimates. This is about the only time I have ever felt good about dropping
my car off at the dealership for repairs.</font></font>
<h2>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">The Results</font></h2>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>How fast is it and how does
it drive? Can you now beat that little punk who has been terrorizing you
in his Supra Turbo and embarrassing you day after day after day?</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>When I picked the car up
it was raining. Not just a regular Seattle rain either but a freak torrential
downpour that made driving this new found power down right scary. I only
got on it once on the way home. Two lane blacktop, straight and no cars
in sight. I barely got into the pedal when the car lost it. I looked over
and saw that the tail end was in the oncoming traffic lane and I was sliding
sideways down the road. I was going 40 when I pressed it too. Fortunately
it is hard to upset the demeanor of the C5 even with an act of stupidity
like my own and a quick flick of the wheel and the release of the throttle
brought me right back in line and I went home slowly the rest of the way.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>To look at the bright side
I was basically thrown into a den of tigers with this level of performance
and such poor weather. I was able to observe driveability under the worst
possible circumstances. I was mostly worried about how this thing would
drive day to day but let me tell you, if anything it is better. There is
really no decrease whatsoever. It feels different but not worse. I know
now that this modification had all benefits and no negatives other than
cost.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>I was also worried a bit
as to how hard it would shift. In a nutshell TransGo gives you four choices
on the shift kit 0 to 4, 0 being basically stock (faster, but no firmer)
and 4 being full race. I chose one because I drive on the streets most
often by far. The 1 to 2 shift is very firm, you can feel a kick in the
booty when it changes but the feel is very solid and purposeful. The other
gear changes are less severe but still more firm than stock. All shifts
are faster by far. I can set off the traction control going from second
to third now.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>When stopped you can take
your foot off the brake and the car will not move forward if there is an
incline at all. It will creep forward ever so slowly if the ground is level.
You press the gas normally and the car drives off smoothly without jerkiness
or high revving power antics. The gear shifts, other than being firmer,
change quicker enough than you can tell, and you are on your way with little
fanfare. The gears are quiet and 60 mph happens at 2000 rpm even. Mileage
drops about 2-3 gallons because of the gears but maybe that's because I
am flooring it more often to force a grin on myself and a look of terror
on my passenger's mug. Power is addictive as the saying goes. If you drive
an auto I sure wish I could take you for a ride in my car because you would
<b>love
it!</b> I do.</font></font>
<h3>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>Out of the Rain</font></font></h3>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>OK, lets talk about some dry
roads and some sunshine. Mother Nature Seattle gave us one nice day last
week and I took advantage of it the best I could. Lets sum it up this way:
when this car hooks up it is unbelievable. Getting traction is a big trouble
because when you floor the car now it seems as if the motor immediately
jets up to 3000 rpm and the power is delivered then. A 3000 rpm neutral
drop or power brake if you will. This will liquefy your tires and put on
a nice smoke show for the kids. You can feather this with a less aggressive
pedal input but I shudder to think how fast this car would launch if the
rubber were up to the job. With practice the task comes down to sitting
there, one foot on the gas and one on the brake, holding revs about 1200.
When you want to go just plop your foot off the brake pedal and gently,
ever so gently, press the throttle to the floor. This will take the car
off with a chirp. It cant be floored too quickly though because the tires
will lose their composure again in the one-two shift so let up a bit here
and let it get into the new gear and then floor it. The tires will give
up a bit of traction during the 2-3 gear change and perhaps a bit of a
fishtail but it is not bad enough to warrant a lighter throttle application.
The rest is just steering.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>Once this is practiced you
can rocket this car to 100 mph in no time at all. It pulls fast and strong
the whole way and is easily the most powerful car I have ever driven or
even ridden in. I haven't been to the track yet so I will save the numbers
for the spring, I am quite sure they will be very impressive.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>The search begins for adequate
tires. I need some good drag tires for the track.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>That's it for preparing the
car for more power. We have a beefy brake system, good handling, and a
great drive train.&nbsp; When you read the next piece the hood will be
up and well see what kind of power you can make in your garage with a set
of tools. Have to go for now, its Supra hunting time.</font></font>
