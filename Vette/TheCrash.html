<font face="Comic Sans MS">Recently I got side swiped by an industrial
garbage truck. Totally ruined the car. So far the estimate is $8200! Luckily
the front bumper and hood have not be damaged. Remember those were replaced
after <a href="#The Fender Bender">The Fender Bender</a>. The car appears
to have held up internally, but ever other piece of the exterior body has
been damaged and needs to be replaced! :-(. Details and pictures are <a href="TheCrash.html">here</a>.</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">The accident occured on California Highway
17. I was entering 17 from Interstate 280 going South. This entrance is
rather large with 2 lanes coming from 280 North and 2 lanes coming in from
280 South. That, plus 880 which changes names to 17 at this point. All
totaled there are 6 lanes of traffic. The right 2 lanes exit to Hamilton
Avenue and get pretty crowded. The left 2 lanes continue down 17 South
toward Santa Cruz and also back up in traffic at rush hour as there are
a lot of people who go over the hill to Santa Cruz.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">This is not an unknown section of road to
me. In fact I travel it frequently. And I usually change into lane #4 (counting
from the divider) which quickly collapses with lane #3. Lanes #3 and #4
quickly merge to one lane. It's sometimes a difficult manuever because
the angel is such that you cannot see people in lane #3 from your side
view mirror. For this reason I always check by turning my head to see what
the traffic situation is like in lane #3 when I enter lane #4 because soon
I will have to merge with that lane.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">This day the coast was clear as far as I
could tell so I got into lane #4 and proceeded to the merge point with
lane #3. The next thing I knew my Vette accelerated about 5 or 10 MPH more
without me giving it any more gas. It soon became apparent to me that I
was being pushed and I was starting to turn sideways, sliding down 17 perpendicular
to the flow of traffic.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Then I continued in a counterclockwise spin,
crossing lanes #2 and #1 and smashed into the concrete divider. Thank God
there was nobody in those 2 lanes. I bounced off of the divider then, once
again hit it about 40-50 feet down.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">I jumped out of the car to survey the damage
but it was clear to me that the damage would be extensive. My right rear
tire and bumper was smashed up against the divider so I went back to the
car to drive it forward away from the divider. By this time traffic was
stopped on the highway so there was no danger. I could not get the door
open - it was smashed closed so I jumped in as the top was down.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">After looking at the rear wheel I saw it
was going flat and the rim was bent beyond repair.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">As far as I can tell the garbage truck driver
must have been in lane #2 and was in the process of changing lanes to lane
#3 at about the point where lane #3 and #4 merge. He could not see me because
his truck is so tall and my Vette is so low. The truck driver made the
comment that he did not see me but was watching to insure he had enough
room in front of the car behind him. I assume he meant to change lanes.
He was probably fixated on his right side view mirror making sure his long
truck would be able to change lanes. From this position he could have easily
missed me being in the lane.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">As you can see by the following photos the
initial impact was with my left rear tire causing me to start spinning
where my driver door was next hit. By this time the garbage truck driver
said he was applying his brakes furiously as he became aware that he had
hit me and was pushing me. Luckily this allowed me to do a 270 degree turn
in front of him heading for the divider. And luckily nobody was in the
other two lanes as I spun past.</font>

passenger's side. My back bumper did a fairly good job of absorbing the
crash into the divider but as I traveled along the divider you can see
how the rear quarter panel scraped up against the concrete. It could have
been much worse I suppose. The bottom of the rim is actually flattened
out a bit causing the flat.</font></caption>
