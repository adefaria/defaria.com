        <h3>Why this song made the list</h3>
        <p>
            Classic song written by Frank Loesser in 1944,
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baby,_It%27s_Cold_Outside">Baby It's Cold Outside</a>
            would never fly in today's politically correct, woke society. Yet still, does anybody think that this
            doesn't go on?
        </p>
        <p>
            This is Brian Setzer's version which I really like. Love the interplay between
            the man and the woman and the real meaning behind the words.
