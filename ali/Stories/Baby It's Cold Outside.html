                        <h3>Why this song made the list</h3>
                        <p>
                            Classic song written by Frank Loesser in 1944,
                            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baby,_It%27s_Cold_Outside">Baby It's Cold Outside</a>
                            would never fly in today's politically correct, woke society. Yet still, does anybody think that this
            doesn't go on?
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This is Brian Setzer's version which I really like. Love the interplay between
            the man and the woman and the real meaning behind the words.

                        I really can't stay
                        <br>
                        Baby, it's cold outside
                        <br>
                        I've got to go away
                        <br>
                        Baby, it's cold outside
                        <br>
                        This evening has been
                        <br>
                        Hoping that you'd drop in
                        <br>
                        So, very nice
                        <br>
                        I'll hold your hands, they're just like ice
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        My mother will start to worry
                        <br>
                        Beautiful, what's your hurry?
                        <br>
                        My father will be pacing the floor
                        <br>
                        Listen to that fireplace roar
                        <br>
                        So, really I'd better scurry
                        <br>
                        Beautiful, please don't hurry
                        <br>
                        But maybe just a hald a drink more
                        <br>
                        I'll put some records on while I pour
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The neighbors might think
                        <br>
                        Baby, it's bad out there
                        <br>
                        Say, what's in this drink?
                        <br>
                        No cabs to be had out there
                        <br>
                        I wish I knew how
                        <br>
                        Your eyes are like starlight now
                        <br>
                        To break this spell
                        <br>
                        I'll take your hat, your hair looks swell
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I ought to say, "No, no, no sir"
                        <br>
                        Mind if I move in closer
                        <br>
                        At least I'm gonna say that I tried
                        <br>
                        What's the sense in hurting my pride?
                        <br>
                        I really can't stay
                        <br>
                        Baby, don't hold out
                        <br>
                        Baby, it's cold outside
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I simply must go
                        <br>
                        Baby, it's cold outside
                        <br>
                        The answer is, "No"
                        <br>
                        But, baby, it's cold outside
                        <br>
                        The welcome has been
                        <br>
                        How lucky that you dropped in
                        <br>
                        So nice and warm
                        <br>
                        Look out the window at that storm
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        My sister will be suspicious
                        <br>
                        Gosh, your lips look delicious
                        <br>
                        My brother will be there at the door
                        <br>
                        Waves upon a tropical shore
                        <br>
                        My maiden aunt's mind is vicious
                        <br>
                        Gosh, your lips are delicious
                        <br>
                        But maybe just a few minutes more
                        <br>
                        Never such a blizzard before
                        <br>
                        I've got to get home
                        <br>
                        Baby, you'll freeze out there
                        <br>
                        Say, I need comb?
                        <br>
                        It's up to your knees out there
                        <br>
                        You've really been grand
                        <br>
                        I thrill when I touch your hand
                        <br>
                        But don't you see?
                        <br>
                        How can you do this thing to me?
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        There's bound to be talk tomorrow
                        <br>
                        Think of my life-long sorrow
                        <br>
                        At least there will be plenty implied
                        <br>
                        If you got pneumonia and died
                        <br>
                        I really can't stay
                        <br>
                        Get over that hold out
                        <br>
                        Baby, it's cold outside
                        <br>
