                        <p>
                            Perhaps it's the Brazilian in me that draws me to Samba music. I would
            love to perform this with you. I think I can separate out the sax as a
            backing track.

                        <h3>Lyrics</h3>
                        Once upon a time it was for real
                        <br>
                        Nothing mattered, then we were together
                        <br>
                        And I couldn't ask for more
                        <br>
                        My dream came true
                        <br>
                        You were nearest to my heart
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I can't make you love me anymore
                        <br>
                        Nothing matters now when you are gone
                        <br>
                        Tried so many times before
                        <br>
                        Only now I understand
                        <br>
                        We never felt the same
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        But I don't mind
                        <br>
                        I don't mind
                        <br>
                        A better combination won't be hard to find
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Got to learn to walk again
                        <br>
                        It's so new, being free
                        <br>
                        Start the life of different kind
                        <br>
                        No more us
                        <br>
                        From now on it's, me
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I know this empty room too well
                        <br>
                        I've got to plan my new life's resolutions
                        <br>
                        First of all I show you how I can survive
                        <br>
                        I never knew that I could laugh like this
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        So I don't mind
                        <br>
                        I don't mind
                        <br>
                        A better combination won't be hard to find
                        <br>
                        Got to learn to walk again
                        <br>
                        It's so new, being free
                        <br>
                        Start the life of different kind
                        <br>
                        No more us
                        <br>
                        From now on it's, me

                        Got to learn to walk again
                        <br>
