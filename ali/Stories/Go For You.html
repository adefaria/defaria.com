                            again with
                            <i>Go For You</i>.

                        <p>
                            Love the low bass here. Also the vocal arrangements are amazing,
            especially by the end how it breaks down to just vocals.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This was included as if to ask, could you go for me?

                        <h3>Lyrics</h3>
                        I'm through with love it's only a madness
                        <br>
                        I'm finished with this this moment was never my joy
                        <br>
                        Who needs a heart break don't want anybody to call my own
                        <br>
                        But when you're near the sweetest sensation
                        <br>
                        Takes over my heart I feel like I'm losing control
                        <br>
                        These moments of weakness allow me a glimpse of heaven
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        But I've been so strong can it be true
                        <br>
                        It's like a mystery too soulful for you broke my resolve
                        <br>
                        Now I'm fighting I try but I cannot deny
                        <br>
                        That I could really go for you
                        <br>
                        Now I'm fighting I try but I cannot deny
                        <br>
                        That I could really go for you
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I'm through with love it's only a madness
                        <br>
                        I'm finished with this this moment was never my joy
                        <br>
                        Who needs a heart break don't want anybody to call my own
                        <br>
                        But when you're near the sweetest sensation
                        <br>
                        Takes over my heart I feel like I'm losing control
                        <br>
                        These moments of weakness allow me a glimpse of heaven
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I'm looking for clues what else to do
                        <br>
                        I take leave of my senses give back all defenses
                        <br>
                        I have to comply can no longer deny
                        <br>
                        That I could really go for you
                        <br>
                        But I have to comply can no longer deny
                        <br>
                        That I could really go for you
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Go for You
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        It could be so good I'm wishing anew
                        <br>
                        Or why should I resent something I've always missed
                        <br>
                        What's the point in my pride if I cannot deny
                        <br>
                        That I could really go for you
                        <br>
                        What's the point in my pride if I cannot deny
                        <br>
                        that I could really go for you
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I'm through with love it's only a madness
