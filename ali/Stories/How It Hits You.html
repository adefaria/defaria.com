                        <p>
                            Jon Anderson, lead singer for the progressive rock act,
                            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yes_(band)">Yes</a>
                            ,
            for decades and decades, did this Christmas album, Three Ships, a while back
            and I've always loved it at this time of year.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Basic theme here from the lyrics is
                            <i>
                                "The spirit of love will always
            connect you"
                            </i>
                            . Notice how it goes into
                            <i>
                                Ding Dong Merrily on
            High
                            </i>
                            briefly.

                        <h3>Lyrics</h3>
                        Who brought this lovely morning
                        <br>
                        Dancin' in my head, can't help but call you
                        <br>
                        Dancin' in my head, can't help but call you
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Who brought here silent teardrops
                        <br>
                        Runnin' through my head, can't help but call you
                        <br>
                        Runnin' through my head, can't help but call you
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        You know the heavens, they'll be dancin'
                        <br>
                        All for singing of the glory of the very day
                        <br>
                        N' in my heart of hearts
                        <br>
                        I knew it from the very start
                        <br>
                        S'taht you'd be with me
                        <br>
                        Aim to jump in
                        <br>
                        Aim to jump high
                        <br>
                        Are you with me
                        <br>
                        Are you with me
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Oh! how it hits you
                        <br>
                        It's so amzing how it hits you
                        <br>
                        Letting go, how it hits you
                        <br>
                        It's so amzing when it hits you
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Who changed this way of thinking
                        <br>
                        Dancin' in my head, can't help but touch you
                        <br>
                        Dancin' in my head, can't help but touch you
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Who stopped my heart from crying
                        <br>
                        Running 'round my head, can't help but want you
                        <br>
                        Running 'round my head, can't help but want you
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I opened the door an' I was mesmerized
                        <br>
                        All the power of the love
                        <br>
                        That shone around me and within me
                        <br>
                        N' in my heart of hearts
                        <br>
                        I know that it had to start
                        <br>
                        N' you'd be with me
                        <br>
                        There's a time for living
                        <br>
                        And a time for loving
                        <br>
                        And are you with me

                        <br>
                        Letting go of the ceiling
                        <br>
