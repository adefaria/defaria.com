        <h3>Why this song made the list</h3>
        <p>
            I found this song some time ago. The vocals are really good and soulful.
            The guitar is really hard to play nicely. Still trying to find a good way
            play it.

            This song is all about the guy saying he'll do anything for the girl.

            I have yet to find a good version of this. Here's one but it's not as well
            produced as the one I have. I mean he's just strumming thought the chords
            where the audio I have is clearly and nicely picked. Also there's no cool,
            sexy sax in the YouTube video.
