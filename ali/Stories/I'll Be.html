                        <h3>Why this song made the list</h3>
                        <p>
                            I found this song some time ago. The vocals are really good and soulful.
            The guitar is really hard to play nicely. Still trying to find a good way
            play it.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This song is all about the guy saying he'll do anything for the girl.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I have yet to find a good version of this. Here's one but it's not as well
            produced as the one I have. I mean he's just strumming thought the chords
            where the audio I have is clearly and nicely picked. Also there's no cool,
            sexy sax in the YouTube video.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Lyrics</h3>
                        The strands in your eyes that color them wonderful
                        <br>
                        Stop me and steal my breath
                        <br>
                        And emeralds from mountains thrust toward the sky
                        <br>
                        Never revealing their depth
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        And tell me that we belong together
                        <br>
                        And dress it up with the trappings of love
                        <br>
                        I'll be captivated, I'll hang from your lips
                        <br>
                        Instead of the gallows of heartache that hang from above
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        And I'll be your cryin' shoulder
                        <br>
                        I'll be love's suicide
                        <br>
                        And I'll be better when I'm older
                        <br>
                        I'll be the greatest fan of your life
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        And rain falls angry on the tin roof
                        <br>
                        As we lie awake in my bed
                        <br>
                        And you're my survival, you're my livin' proof
                        <br>
                        My love is alive and not dead
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        And tell me that we belong together
                        <br>
                        And dress it up with the trappings of love
                        <br>
                        I'll be captivated, I'll hang from your lips
                        <br>
                        Instead of the gallows of heartache that hang from above
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        And I'll be your cryin' shoulder
                        <br>
                        I'll be love's suicide
                        <br>
                        And I'll be better when I'm older
                        <br>
                        I'll be the greatest fan of your life
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        And I dropped out, I burned up
                        <br>
                        I fought my way back from the dead
                        <br>
                        Tuned in and turned on
                        <br>
                        Remembered the thing that you, you said
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        And I'll be your cryin' shoulder
                        <br>
                        I'll be love's suicide
                        <br>
                        And I'll be better when I'm older
                        <br>
                        I'll be the greatest fan of your
                        <br>
                        I'll be your cryin' shoulder
                        <br>
                        I'll be love's suicide
                        <br>
                        And I'll be better when I'm older
                        <br>
                        I'll be the greatest fan of your life
