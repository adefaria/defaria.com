                        <h3>Lyrics</h3>
                        Oh, the weather outside is frightful
                        <br>
                        But the fire is so delightful
                        <br>
                        And since we've no place to go
                        <br>
                        Let it snow! Let it snow! Let it snow!
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Man it doesn't show signs of stopping
                        <br>
                        And I brought me some corn for popping
                        <br>
                        The lights are turned way down low
                        <br>
                        Let it snow! Let it snow! Let it snow!
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        When we finally kiss goodnight
                        <br>
                        How I'll hate going out in the storm
                        <br>
                        But if you'll really hold me tight
                        <br>
                        All the way home I'll be warm
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        And the fire is slowly dying
                        <br>
                        And, my dear, we're still goodbying
                        <br>
                        But as long as you'd love me so
                        <br>
                        Let it snow! Let it snow! Let it snow!
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        When we finally kiss goodnight
                        <br>
                        How I'll hate going out in the storm
                        <br>
                        But if you'll really hold me tight
                        <br>
                        All the way home I'll be warm
                        <br>
