                        <h3>Why this song made the list</h3>
                        <p>
                            The essence of this song is a common theme for
                            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Anderson">Jon Anderson</a> and
                            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yes_(band)">Yes</a>,
            about how magical it is when you discover love of another person. This
            song is so driving, with a rolling rhythm and a break down at the end
            and it just fabulous.

                        <h3>Lyrics</h3>
                        What you gonna do when the lightning strikes and hits you
                        <br>
                        Who ya gonna call for the secret of stealing the world
                        <br>
                        Swimming in this ocean of words on your new cellphone
                        <br>
                        Diving for the wisdom of pearls in your eyes
                        <br>
                        Come on
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        What ya gonna do when the lightning strikes and hits you
                        <br>
                        How ya gonna laugh when the joker forgets his lines
                        <br>
                        Stepping off a cloud into space whatever greets you
                        <br>
                        Show me how you got this award for being alive
                        <br>
                        Waking up is waking to the power
                        <br>
                        Dancing up is dancing till the dawn
                        <br>
                        Talk talk talk will always get you someplace
                        <br>
                        Shake it up 'n' shake me till I'm done
                        <br>
                        Shake it up now!
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        She ay... Do wa bap
                        <br>
                        She ay... Do wa bap
                        <br>
                        She ay... Do wa bap
                        <br>
                        She ay... Do wa bap
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Who ya gonna call when the power begins to chase you
                        <br>
                        Spinning out of shape now you're learning to live again
                        <br>
                        Fastening your seatbelt tonight it could get jumpy
                        <br>
                        Showing me the good 'n' that
                        <br>
