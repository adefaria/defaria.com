                        <p>
                            This song has a long introduction but bear through it until the vocals start at around 2:06.
            Jon's singing about a new language - a new language of love!

                        <h3>Lyrics</h3>
                        I speak from some sort of protection of learning
                        <br>
                        Even tho' I make it up as I go on
                        <br>
                        A special trait is that I've tried to reach all feelings
                        <br>
                        So I speak a new language of love
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Some say that it is written in the circle
                        <br>
                        Others that it is written in the sun
                        <br>
                        But I protect myself by seeing this experience
                        <br>
                        As a metaphor for moving on
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Sometimes I check myself to start to believe in
                        <br>
                        The horoscopes you read everyday
                        <br>
                        They're telling me somethings I really ought to know
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        But then again I like to then again I learn to
                        <br>
                        But then again I'm running away
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Vision is coming so fast I can't stop myself
                        <br>
                        Vision forgets who is real on the city streets
                        <br>
                        People get lost just waiting for history
                        <br>
                        Pushing the real world away
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Taking a chance only once in your life
                        <br>
                        Only weakness can stop you from hearing new languages
                        <br>
                        Translate each word as they bring you creation
                        <br>
                        Your voice is the perfect key
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Is there something that I'm supposed to see
                        <br>
                        Is there something that I'm supposed to feel
                        <br>
                        I'm with you and I can't help but want to know
                        <br>
                        (Talk to me)
                        <br>
                        Is there something that I'm supposed to teach
                        <br>
                        (Speak to me)
                        <br>
                        Is there something that I'm supposed to find
                        <br>
                        As I reach to the healing in each spoken word
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        For some strange reason time just cannot wait a minute
                        <br>
                        I'm chasing every second before I let go
                        <br>
                        Yesterday my history dreams are still a mystery
                        <br>
                        This living is a gift I should know
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Lay it down and let me live the new language
                        <br>
                        Let me learn at every twist every turn
                        <br>
                        Lay it down and let me love the further future
                        <br>
                        Let me know I'm running
                        <br>
                        Let me know I'm learning
                        <br>
                        Let me know I'm moving on
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Vision is racing so fast I can't stop myself
                        <br>
                        Chasing the reason for all kinds of wondering
                        <br>
                        People embracing these feelings of limbo
                        <br>
                        Just waiting for some kind of truth
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Taking a chance as it comes only once
                        <br>
                        Only strength can do justice with words of new languages
                        <br>
                        Translate creation to bring you salvation
                        <br>
                        Your voice is the perfect key
                        <br>
