                            Oh, holy night
                            <br>
                            The stars are brightly shining
                            <br>
                            It is the night of our dear savior's birth
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Long lay the world
                            <br>
                            In sin and horror crying
                            <br>
                            Till He appeared
                            <br>
                            And the soul felt more alive
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            The thrill of hope
                            <br>
                            The weary world rejoices
                            <br>
                            For yonder breaks
                            <br>
                            A new and glorious morn
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Fall on your knees
                            <br>
                            Oh, hear the angel voices
                            <br>
                            O, night divine
                            <br>
                            O, night when Christ was born
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Truly he taught us
                            <br>
                            To love one another
                            <br>
                            His law in love
                            <br>
                            And His gospel in peace
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Chains shall He break
                            <br>
                            For the slave in our brother
                            <br>
                            And in His name all oppression shall cease
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Sweet hymns of joy
                            <br>
                            A grateful chorus sing we
                            <br>
                            Let all within us praise His holy name
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            O night divine
                            <br>
                            O night when Christ was born
                            <br>
                            O night divine
                            <br>
                            O night
                            <br>
                            O night divine
                            <br>
                            O night divine
