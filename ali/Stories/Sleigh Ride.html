                        Just hear those sleigh bells jingling
                        <br>
                        Ring ting tingling too
                        <br>
                        Come on, it's lovely weather
                        <br>
                        For a sleigh ride together with you
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Outside the snow is falling
                        <br>
                        And friends are calling "yoo hoo,"
                        <br>
                        Come on, it's lovely weather
                        <br>
                        For a sleigh ride together with you
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Our cheeks are nice and rosy
                        <br>
                        And comfy cozy are we
                        <br>
                        We're snuggled up together
                        <br>
                        Like two birds of a feather would be
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Let's take that road before us
                        <br>
