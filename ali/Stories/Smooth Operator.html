                        <h3>Lyrics</h3>
                        Diamond life, lover boy
                        <br>
                        We move in space with minimum waste and maximum joy
                        <br>
                        City lights and business nights
                        <br>
                        When you require streetcar desire for higher heights
                        <br>
                        No place for beginners or sensitive hearts
                        <br>
                        When sentiment is left to chance
                        <br>
                        No place to be ending but somewhere to start
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        No need to ask
                        <br>
                        He's a smooth operator
                        <br>
                        Smooth operator
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Coast to coast, LA to Chicago, western male
                        <br>
                        Across the north and south, to Key Largo, love for sale
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Face to face, each classic case
                        <br>
                        We shadow box and double cross
                        <br>
                        Yet need the chase
                        <br>
                        A license to love, insurance to hold
                        <br>
                        Melts all your memories and change into gold
                        <br>
                        His eyes are like angels but his heart is cold
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        No need to ask
                        <br>
                        He's a smooth operator
                        <br>
                        Smooth operator
                        <br>
