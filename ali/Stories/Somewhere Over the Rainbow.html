        <h3>Why this song made the list</h3>
        <p>
            What's there to say about Tommy Emmanuel that hasn't been said before?
            This is a wonderful rendition of that classic song
            <i>Somewhere Over the Rainbow</i>
            that Tommy does here I believe in his house. Just wonderful. Tugs the heartstrings eh?
        </p>
        <p>
            I think Tommy performs this from his house
