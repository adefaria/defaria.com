        <h3>Why this song made the list</h3>
        <p>
            Another sultry singer,
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basia" target="_blank">
                Basia
            Trzetrzelewska
            </a>
            (say that 3 times fast!), Polish by heritage, married
            a British piano playing bloke and does Brazilian samba music.
        </p>
        <p>
            It's interesting that Basia here sings about meeting potential lovers
            but sticking to her guns that she has her career to pursue. There's a
            line here "He found my
            <i>joie de vivre</i>
            so cute and rather touching".
            I had to look up what
            <a href="https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/joie%20de%20vivre#:~:text=People%20who%20seem%20to%20enjoy,frequently%20used%20by%20English%20speakers." target="_blank">joie de vivre</a>
            meant.
            When Jackie asked me what I thought of you Ali, I said "I find her joie de vivre so cute and rather touching".
            I don't think Jackie got the full meaning here.
