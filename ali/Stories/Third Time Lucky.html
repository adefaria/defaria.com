                        <h3>Why this song made the list</h3>
                        <p>
                            Another sultry singer,
                            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basia" target="_blank">
                                Basia
                            Trzetrzelewska
                            </a>
                            (say that 3 times fast!), Polish by heritage, married
                            a British piano playing bloke and does Brazilian samba music.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It's interesting that Basia here sings about meeting potential lovers
                            but sticking to her guns that she has her career to pursue. There's a
                            line here "He found my
                            <i>joie de vivre</i>
                            so cute and rather touching".
                            I had to look up what
                            <a href="https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/joie%20de%20vivre#:~:text=People%20who%20seem%20to%20enjoy,frequently%20used%20by%20English%20speakers." target="_blank">joie de vivre</a>
                            meant.
                            When Jackie asked me what I thought of you Ali, I said "I find her joie de vivre so cute and rather touching".
                            I don't think Jackie got the full meaning here.

                        First one--it's a shock
                        <br>
                        A second helping--not good enough
                        <br>
                        Third time lucky--and you've arrived!
                        <br>
                        If you have any doubts then try once more...
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Maybe I was too impressed...
                        <br>
                        He flattered--I was blushing
                        <br>
                        He found my

                        so cute and rather touching
                        <br>
                        Himself so upwardly mobile, so cerebral, clever
                        <br>
                        Could I ever live up to his dreams
                        <br>
                        Or would I like to play a part in his scheme?
                        <br>
                        I don't think so...
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I have my plans and brave ambition
                        <br>
                        Knowing no bounds, no inhibitions
                        <br>
                        'nd I'm aware there's a lesson in every fall
                        <br>
                        So next time I'll get closer

                        Later I met a boy whose inner life was his true passion
                        <br>
                        We did connect in an exploratory fashion
                        <br>
                        He claimed what tie us to this mortal coil we should sever
                        <br>
                        Could I ever live up to his dreams

                        Oh I fear not...

                        I have my plans and brave ambition
