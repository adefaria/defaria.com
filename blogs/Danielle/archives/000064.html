                              <p>Halloween was relatively uneventual this year, especially compared to last year when my wife was thrown in jail for domestic violence a week or two before.</p>

<p>Danni was a biker chick and she and her best friend Destiny, did some trick or treating at Uncle Kevin and Poppies for a while. They seemed to like one house where the teenage boys of the house dressed as Freddie and Jason, etc and would scare the trick or treaters. I think it's more a girls and boys sort of thing but the scare thing is fun at Halloween.</p>

<p>Then we went to Destiny's neigborhood and did some trick or treating there and finally at my new apartment. Seems to me that every year more and more people simply don't do Halloween. I mean many of the places we went to had lights on, often with Halloween decorations and still nobody would answer the door. Seems just rude to me. I guess it was just different when I was a kid back in Jersey although there were many houses that didn't answer the door. But it seemed to me that they were generally dark and/or devoid of any Halloween decorations.</p>
