                              <p>I had just come back from visiting my Mom and had been away from Danni for a week. Mary-Anne was kind enough to pick me up at San Francisco Airport. Danni was glad to see me and woke up immediately when she heard my voice (it was late and she was sleeping). We were waiting for my luggage when Mary-Anne had said that Stuart, her husband, was in the van circling the airport in order to avoid having to park. She said that Danni was tired and that she had debated leaving Danni in the van with Stuart. At that point Danni stood up, stamped her foot and said "<i>I haven't seen my Daddy in one whole week and you wanted to leave me in the car! <b>I don't think so!</b></i>" I told her Mary-Anne that I didn't think that she should be teaching Danni the "I don't think so" phrase that Mary-Anne was tending to use a lot as of late.</p>
