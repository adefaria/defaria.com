                              <p>I had Danielle for Christmas Eve and Christmas morning. It was interesting having her for the night and her excitement level was up about Santa Claus. We had watched a couple of Christmas videos including The Santa Clause by Tim Allen in which Tim becomes the Santa Claus when he accidently kills the old Santa. During the movie it is said that Santa Claus will come down the heater if the house has no chimney. As a result Danni insisted that I hang her stocking next to my heater.</p>

<p>Mary-Anne describes a story about Danielle and Christmas: Danielle was being a pretend reindeer and we wanted her to stop so we could decorate the tree. Danielle had been talking to the tree since we had cut it down. She would tell it not too worry that we were taking it home and he would have a nice place to live. We told her that the christmas tree was scared that she was being a reindeer cause reindeers eat christmas tree. She apoligized to the tree and promised she would not eat it.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, while riding home to my house one day Danni leaned over and whispered into my ear so faint that I could not hear her. I asked her to speak louder and she say she couldn't because the trees might hear. Not remember we're in a car traveling on a freeway at 65 MPH with the windows closed. Then she told me the secret that her mom had told her, that reindeers eat Christmas trees and said that she didn't want the trees to hear that because they would be frightened.</p>

<p>This year I also put out an <a href="/Family/Christmas/1996.html">Electronic Christmas Card</a>.</p>
