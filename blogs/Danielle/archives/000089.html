                              <p>Recently Danielle was having diarreah(sp?) and had green "poopies". We talked about the green poopies and how she didn't know that it was coming and that her tummy didn't feel good, etc.</p>

<p>Her Mom was also not feeling good recently and stayed home from work keeping Danni home from preschool. I talked with Danni about her Mom not feeling well hoping to relate it to when Danni wasn't feeling well. Well the association was made but in a strange way. When speaking about Mommies bad tummy Danni told me that Mommy was in the bathroom a lot. I immediately understood that her Mom must have regruitated. But Danni put it into words that only a 3 year old could "Yeah, she had green poopies come from her mouth". Kinda gross but cute. </p>
