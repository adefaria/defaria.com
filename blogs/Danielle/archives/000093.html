                              <p>Dannielle's first trip to the Circus was nothing more than the best! Ringling Brothers and Barum Baily Circus AKA The Greatest Show on Earth.</p>

<p>I tried real hard to get Danni to take a nap before we went but she never did. She were real tired by the time she, her mother and I got to the San Jose Arena where the circus was at, but the look of surprize and wonder in her eye was well worth it. She tried desperately to stay away and managed to do so for the entire show, switching between Mommy's and Daddy's lap.</p>

<p>She really liked the little baby elephants that the circus had named Romeo and Juliet. We had also gotten Danni a few toys and coloring books featuring these baby elephants which she seems to enjoy. I can only guess that Danni must have slept like a rock after the circus as she was pretty pooped by the end of it. </p>
