                              <p>One day Danni and I were running behind schedule. I had got pizza for dinner and decided to rent a video for Danni (I was sick of Winnie the Pooh and wanted something different myself). We went to BlockBuster and got Snow White. I handed the video to Danni (she likes putting them in the VCR), turned on the TV and VCR and proceeded to get dinner ready. Danni was having trouble with the tape. She got it in and it started to play but then stopped. "Help me Daddy" she said. I came over and ejected the tape. It was all tangled up as often happens with audio casettes. This was the first time this ever happened to me.</p>

<p>So I took the tape over to the bathroom, got a powered screwdriver and started to remove the screws in the tape case. I took the tape apart and examined the mechanisms therein. I was trying like hell to fix the kink in the tape and get it all back together again. Sweat was pouring from my brow and dropping on the tape. Danni came into the bathroom and said "It's broke?". "Yes it's broke, but Daddy's gonna try to fix it" I said. "You fix it Daddy!" she replied.</p>

<p>Then the tape fell apart before my eyes. This is when I started relating to the Bill Cosby story of when his father lost his mind, unable to complete sentences. "God... err... well why does BlockBuster have such shi..." I said. I was losing my ability to complete sentences! Just like Bill's dad! I was mad, angry and frustrated. I didn't need this. It's now 9:00 PM and my daughter's in PJ's. Am I gonna have to go back to BlockBuster now?</p>

<p>But Danni has a way of brightening up moments like this. She climbed up on the toilet lid, patted me ever so gently on the back looking intensely at what I was doing and said "Good boy Daddy! You fix it!".</p>

<p>Unfortunately I couldn't fix it and had to return to BlockBuster. I gave the tape to the employee there and explained that it got tangled up and I tried to fix it. He said that in the future I should try to fix it myself. You try telling that to a two year old!</p>
