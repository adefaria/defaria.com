                              <p>Recently tragedy struck Diamond, Danielle's dog. Mary-Anne, her mother, explains:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hello All,</p>

<p>I wanted to let you know about our little sheltie.  The gate got left opened by Accident on Tuesday and I was inside with 2 toddlers and a newborn.  When I noticed that Diamond wasn’t in the back yard I went out and called for her.  She was on the other side of the gate.  As I let her in I noticed that she was not walking on her front left foot.  I picked her up to see if she had something in her foot and realized there was something terribly wrong with her leg.  I called Stuart and the Vet right away.  I called Poppy and she called her husband for me (needless to say I was quite upset) He rushed over from his job at our church and took the dog to the vet for me.  Stuart met him there and we found out she had a Dislocated leg (Same Elbow as mine same type of brake)They took ex-rays and bandaged her up and we need to keep her quite for a week.   In a week time the bandage will come off and hopefully with a lot of prayers she will be fine and just need a little physical therapy.  If not then it is surgery.  So if you could all pray that would be appreciated.</p>

<p>This is a Diamond and she is a really good dog, very good with the kids.</p>
