                              <p>To understand this story you must know who PuttPutt is. PuttPutt is a cartoon car who lives on a CD ROM. He is part of a interactive, multimedia game that I got for Danni. In this game you have to "solve" the problem by getting a balloon, a dog and washing PuttPutt the car. You travel around meeting other characters and can use a mouse to select object on the screen which make noises, spin or talk to you. If you do all that you are supposed to you join the parade and effectively win the game. Danni loves the game and we play it often.</p>

<p>One day, Danni noticed that my van was dirty. I thought it might be interesting to take her to a car wash. Ya know, the kind that you do yourself with the spray gun. Thought she might enjoy helping.</p>

<p>We were gonna go to the Gilroy Garlic Festival (which usually has a dusty parking area) so I decide to delay washing the van until we got back.</p>

<p>The festival was fun. We got a Simba balloon (Simba is the baby lion in the Walt Disney move The Lion King) and generally had fun but Danni soon grew tired, longing for her nap, and I grew tired of carrying her so we decided to go home.</p>

<p>I was talking to her about the fun we had and said "We got you a Simba balloon didn't we". "Simba balloon" Danni replied. "And when we get home we could go and wash Daddy's van, or we could play PuttPutt again" I said. She smiled and said "Wash Daddy's van. Just like PuttPutt!"</p>
