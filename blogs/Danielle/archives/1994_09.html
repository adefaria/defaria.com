                              <p>Dannielle's first trip to the Circus was nothing more than the best! Ringling Brothers and Barum Baily Circus AKA The Greatest Show on Earth.</p>

<p>I tried real hard to get Danni to take a nap before we went but she never did. She were real tired by the time she, her mother and I got to the San Jose Arena where the circus was at, but the look of surprize and wonder in her eye was well worth it. She tried desperately to stay away and managed to do so for the entire show, switching between Mommy's and Daddy's lap.</p>

<p>She really liked the little baby elephants that the circus had named Romeo and Juliet. We had also gotten Danni a few toys and coloring books featuring these baby elephants which she seems to enjoy. I can only guess that Danni must have slept like a rock after the circus as she was pretty pooped by the end of it. </p>

                              <p>Danni started attending Primary Plus preschool this month. Her mother and I put her in here so that Mary-Anne could start working. The preschool seems like a well run school. It is really daycare with some schooling. It is in an only public school that they have bought and converted.</p>

<p>Danni is at a good age for this as she always likes being with other kids and making friends. I believe she is having some trouble though with some boys picking on her (little boys can be rough). She sometimes seems fearful and mentions that "Nicky" did something to her. I'm trying hard to balance between understanding her and trying to overly protect her and realizing that she must also learn to deal with other kids. I've alerted the teacher that somebody named "Nicky" may be picking on Dannielle and to keep her eyes open.</p>

<p>Meantime I try to explain to Danni that sometimes kids are a little to rough and sometimes they come around. I point out that Kiel, one Mary-Anne's former daycare kids that Danni grew to love, was originally rough with her. I'm not sure how much she understood but it did seem to calm her down somewhat.</p>

<p>Danni seems to participate well in class, whether making things or sitting around for story time. </p>
