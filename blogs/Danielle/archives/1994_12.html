                              <p>I'd say that Christmas 1994 is Danni's first real Christmas. I've started trying to teach her Christmas songs by singing them to her. At first she would stare at me in amazement. "Daddy's singing differents songs" was her expression, but soon she was determined to learn to words to these new, unfamilar yet wonderful songs. Jingle Bells was the first one she took to. She liked the chorus because it was easy for her but she insisted on me singing the other parts too. What I was unaware of was that she wanted me to sing these because she was learning the words. She also like the Oh! and Hey! parts of the song.</p>

<p>At Thanksgiving I took a vacation but by the time I was back Dannielle had Jingle Bells down. I turned to her an asked if she knew any other Christmas songs and she thought for a second and to my surprize started belting out Rudolf the Red Nosed Reindeer with all the words.</p>

<p>She now loves to sit on Santa's lap and to watch Christmas stories. This Christmas should be an interesting one.</p>

<p>Christmas itself was interesting. Danni was really into it and basically walked around like a kid on speed. She really has gotten the open presents thing down! She had gotten many presents including a dollhouse from me and a kitchen set from her Mom. Now we just need to teach her that Christmas is only on day out of the year - she wants a repeat - tomorrow! </p>
