                              <p>During this month we've had an unusual amount of rainfall here in Northern California and as a result it seemed pointless to wash the van. However one day Danni insisted that my car was dirty and wanted to go through the car wash even though it was still raining. Rather than try to talk sense into a 3 year old I gave in and decided to wash the van for the fun of it.</p>

<p>The van is big and I get worried that the automated car washes may damage it so I got out of the van and folded back the side view mirrors. When I got back into the van Danni said "You're car got ears!". </p>

                              <p>Recently Danielle was having diarreah(sp?) and had green "poopies". We talked about the green poopies and how she didn't know that it was coming and that her tummy didn't feel good, etc.</p>

<p>Her Mom was also not feeling good recently and stayed home from work keeping Danni home from preschool. I talked with Danni about her Mom not feeling well hoping to relate it to when Danni wasn't feeling well. Well the association was made but in a strange way. When speaking about Mommies bad tummy Danni told me that Mommy was in the bathroom a lot. I immediately understood that her Mom must have regruitated. But Danni put it into words that only a 3 year old could "Yeah, she had green poopies come from her mouth". Kinda gross but cute. </p>

                              <p>I took Dannielle ice skating this month after she seemed interested in figure skating on TV. We had a blast and went for about 2 hours. My back was hurting because at her age ice skating consists of raising her hands and me pulling her around the ice.</p>

                              <p>I took Dannielle horseback riding this month. I have gone to these stables before mostly to show Dannielle the horses as she was afraid of them. This time she seemed to like the idea of trying to ride one. Well we tried but she was just to scared of the horse. So we hung around and watched other little kids ride horses.</p>

<p>Eventually Danni wanted to try again. I was leary as she was scared the first time but she managed to get on a pony named Aboo (after the character in Disney's Aladdin movie). After getting accustomed to Aboo she was even saying "Gittiup!". I quickly taught her the other command: Whoa!</p>
