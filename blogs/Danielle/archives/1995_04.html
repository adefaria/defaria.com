                              <p>For Danielle's 3rd birthday I decided to take her to Disneyland. Mary-Anne also came with us. We settled into our hotel and then went to Disneyland the next day. My plan was to do Disneyland in the morning, then go back to the hotel for lunch and relaxing returning to Disneyland for the afternoon/evening so that we could watch the parades and fireworks.</p>

<p>For the most part we sticked to that plan and it worked well. Danni was excited to see all the Disney character that she has grown to know watching all of the Disney movies. At first she was slightly frightened by the huge Disney characters but warmed up to them pretty quickly.</p>

<p>We also went on many rides. Danni would complain that Daddy only liked the scary rides because she was too young for some of them and didn't like the ones that moved too quickly or were slightly scarey. This limited which rides we could go on to things like the Tea Cups and "It's a Small World". Danni really liked "It's a Small World" ride, learning that blasted, repeatitive song quickly and often singing it!</p>

<p>For the most part Danni was very well behaved and pretty overwhelmed. She also got a little scared at the Dragon (from Pete's Dragon I believe) in the Electric Parade but enjoyed the fireworks. We also saw a Water Fantasy display at night which was quite impressive.</p>

<p>As for how Mary-Anne and I coped, we did fairly well as we have a pretty good friendship but it was a reaffirmation for both of us as to why we didn't work well together. </p>
