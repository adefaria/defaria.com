                              <p>Recently Dannielle has learned to use the mouse on the computer. She was usually pretty attentive when we would play computer games together often pointing out on the screen what she wanted the mouse to do but I had to do it. We would even play a "concentration" type game where one has to remember and match up like pictures on "cards" that were turned around. She was good at this, solving even the most difficult level.</p>

<p>Now, however, she can do it herself! One day I just decided to not help her because I was busy trying to get dinner ready. To my surprise she started using the mouse to do her own playing. She was extremely proud of herself, as was I, and motivated to do more. She played the "concentration" game and solved it all by herself! She now also plays PuttPutt by herself. It's as if it finally clicked (no pun intended) with her. Occasionally she'll say that she wants my help or that she cannot do it. Then I'll show her and try to explain what is going on. She seems to take that new found knowledge and apply it herself now.</p>
