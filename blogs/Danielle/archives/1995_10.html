                              Danielle's questions are really getting tough now!

All children eventually get to the "Whys" and parents are expected to answer these questions even when no answer seems possible. You also must balance between honesty and answers that are too detail for the child's understanding at this point in their lives.

Children have a knack for coming up with interesting questions and for looking at things with a totally different viewpoint than parents are used to. They are often refreshingly honest too.

For exmaple, I was trying to explain to her how you really need to brush your teeth because the food gets in there and eats way at your teeth causing cavities. Then you need to go to the dentist to get them fixed and that can hurt.

Danielle looks at me and askes "What happens if you don't eat?".

Later Danielle asked me "What happens if you go to sleep and you don't wake up?".

                              <p>Recently Danielle was playing on the computers. Often I give here something to drink while doing so. This time she had chocolate milk. Well she spilled the chocolate milk and it began running under the computer! In a furry I tried to clean up the milk before it damaged the computer. Danielle knew that that was a no no and she sensed that I was upset. She kept saying that it was just an accident. It's difficult to hold one's temper when just and accident is threatening to ruin an expensive piece of equipment like the computer. I was trying to explain to her that some accidents are not good and that she should be more careful. I decided to tell her that if she could not handle being careful with a drink around the computer then she could no longer have them by the computer. She could sense that she did something wrong and that Daddy was upset.</p>

<p>She was sitting on the floor by now and was like a dog with its tail between its legs. Then she looked up at me and held out her hand with the index, pinky and thumb extended and she said that that means that I love you. That hand gesture is sign language for I love you and is something that her mom had taught her (Back when her mom and I were together Mary-Anne would do that to me and taught me that sign). Needless to say it was so cute that it made it hard for me to remain angry with her (which was OK because I was not trying to be angry with her, rather I wanted to impress upon her the importance of being careful and doing the right thing than to resort to punishment).</p>
