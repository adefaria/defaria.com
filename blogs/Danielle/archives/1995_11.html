                              <p>My mother has become ill with cancer and for Thanksgiving this year my sisters Tina and Cindy decided to visit with Mom. I decided that this would be a good time to take Danni for her first real trip with daddy away from mommy and also visit my mother.</p>

<p>Danni did well on the plane even though it took of early in the morning. When we arrived in New Jersey on Thanksgiving day we were picked up by Aunt Tina and taking to Grandma's house.</p>

<p>Thanksgiving dinner itself was good and the relatives really enjoyed having Danni around. During the next couple of days we stayed at Grandma's. Danni got some early Christmas gifts and everybody enjoyed how cute Danni was.</p>

<p>We went to New York to see Rockefeller Center, various store's Christmas displayes and other such sight seeing in the big city. There were street Santa's, which Danni was excited to see and other things. Danni seemed to take New York in stride and Grandma seemed to manage.</p>

<p>In a fit of stupidity I missed our return flight and had to return the following day. The weather in New Jersey was uncommonly warm but that last day the temperature dropped and it snowed so at least Danni got to make some snowballs before we left. Like all little kids she wanted to take one home!</p>
