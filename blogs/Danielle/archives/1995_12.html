                              <p>Christmas 1995 was marked by me moving into a 2 bedroom apartment. As such my main focus was on setting up a bedroom for Danni. So her Christmas gift this year was a new, complete bedroom set. Obviously that would not do for a 3 year old so I had also purchased some other toys for her.</p>

<p>I also decided to get the artificial Christmas tree this year. It really confused Danni because she was used to cutting down a Christmas tree as it was a Flood custom. I had to explain to her that we were gonna build a Christmas tree and that she could help. After some initial hesitation she got into it and help me put the tree together and decorate it.</p>

<p>Danni came over after spending Christmas morning over Beama's and opened her presents with reverance. She really knows what presents are and how to open them now! After doing that I told her to put her toys into her room. She seems sort of fully furnished (something Daddy worked furiously on putting together the day before!). For a three year old her surprize was, I'd say, better than average. In the nights that followed she grew more accustomed to having her own room, her own bed, etc. She's pretty good at putting her stuff away and knowing where it goes.</p>
