                              <p>Danielle quickly got interested in marriage and the whole custom. She described to me once what getting married was all about. "When you get married - You go to church and you stand before God", she said with a wonderment in her eyes and voice. She continued, "And at the end, you kiss!". I thought that was cute and said, "That's cute dear". She continued further, "Yeah and then you open your mouth!" at which point I turned tto her with a distinct look in my eye saying to myself, "Where did she learn that!".</p>

                              <p>Danni's real first bike was a tricycle that her mom got her however Danni's school was having "bike day" so I thought that I should buy Danni a two wheeler (with training wheels). Danni was all excited about her new bike and was very good about wearing her helmet.</p>
