                              <p>Danni has been getting into helping Daddy drive. She no longer needs to use a car seat and sits strapped into the front seat. I had brought Mary-Anne's old Dodge Colt and it had a stick shift. Danni became curious and offered to help shift the stick for me. I told her that I was in a parking lot right now and I couldn't let her do it. She said that she would wait until we got into the "free road" and then she would shift it for me.</p>

                              <p>Preschool had a summer program of swimming lessons that I signed Danni up for. Soon she would talking about how she would blow bubbles in the water and do things at "the green wall". Whenever she would visit she would want to go swimming and show me what she's been learning in swim class. I signed her up for the next two weeks of swimming lessons.</p>
