                              <p>One day while driving Danni to school I told her that Daddy was thinking of getting his hair done again and that I might color is back to my natural brown color. Danni ask why and I said because my grey hairs were showing through and the black color that I had only made them more noticable. Well Danni had been carrying around a stone from school that she called a Magic Stone. She told me to bend down and she waved the Magic Stone over my head. I sat up and she said, "All better". "What? You mean that you don't see any more grey?", I said. "No, I don't see any more black!", she replied. I laughed at that one even though now I realized that she probably meant that she turned my hair all brown.</p>
