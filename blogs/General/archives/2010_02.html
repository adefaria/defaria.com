                              <p>Why do people do the following: A user is having difficulty performing a task so they submit a ticket. Attached there's a zip file that contains a Word document of 5 pages, 4 of which are entire desktop screen shots showing each steps in it's huge glory taking up tons of space where screen shot 4 has the error dialog that I need! Further, page 5 has the textual representation, which is really all I needed and is copy and pastable!</p>

<p>Now before you say "Well they didn't know and they were trying to be helpful providing you with all the information" consider this: What the hell was the zip file for? There was only 1 file in it. Why zip it? "Well Andy, you hard ass, at least they are saving space because the zip file will compress it". Well then, riddle me this batman, why then capture the entire damn screen probably in the wasteful bmp format! And if you just wished to send me a bunch of screen captures why didn't you put only those in a zip file instead of having to call Word - and all it's inefficiencies - into play?</p>

<p>The end result is that they do it in the most inefficient and complicated way they can find!</p>

                              <p>Do people think at all how they come off to other people? Case in point - I want to set my Unix password but for some reason they've disabled the passwd(1) command. Off to the help desk it is for me! Apparently I have not paid enough penance.</p>

<p>So the conversation goes as follows:</p>

<div class=code>Helpdesk dude ...hi Andrew how are you doing today<br>
1:33:39 PM◄want to talk to you please ping me,regarding unix<br>
2:30:50 PM Andrew DeFaria And your number is... <br>

2:32:09 PM ◄as you called in for unix password setup  <br>
2:32:17 PM Andrew DeFaria Yes. <br>
2:32:37 PM Helpdesk dude ...you already logged in however you want to setup a password  <br>
2:33:37 PM Andrew DeFaria Yes, why doesn't the passwd(1) command work? <br>
2:34:30 PM Helpdesk dude ...please give me one minute<br>

2:44:46 PM Andrew DeFaria I find it hard to believe that I'm unique in wanting to set my Unix password...  <br>
2:45:51 PM Helpdesk dude ...do not worry sir we will try our best to fix thix issue  <br>
2:46:04 PM Andrew DeFaria Did I say I was worried?  <br>
2:46:35 PM Helpdesk dude ...i really appologize for that   <br>
2:46:39 PM Andrew DeFaria  That's OK, this is making a great blog entry...  <br>
</div>

<p>Aside from the atrocious English spelling and grammar of this supposed College educated support tech... First off, why's he explaining my problem back to me? I know my problem - I'm not stupid.</p>

<p>Secondly, maybe ya should come to the party prepared! I mean the problem here is simple - a user simply wants to set his password. Have you read the trouble ticket? Do you understand the issues involve? Great <b>then</b> contact the user. But here clearly he state "please give me one minute" - Then clearly takes several! Shouldn't he have the solution in hand?</p>

                        <h3 class="entry-header">Insisting on breaking links</h3>
                        <div class="entry-content">
                           <div class="entry-body">
                              <p>The reluctance to use HTML in email (and news groups for that matter) is astonishing! Instead people insist on using plain text and inevitably paste long links that break due to stupid clients badly wrapping the URL. For example:</p>

<div class=code>
http://gisclarifyweb.somewhere.com/eSupport/eSupportjsp/MenuSystem/CaseViewMS.j^M
sp?casenum=G03519757
</div>

<blockquote><b>Note:</b> "^M" included to indicate where the line wrap occurs as this blog software will wrap it differently</blockquote>
<p>Email clients then linkify the first part (http://gisclarifyweb.somewhere.com/eSupport/eSupportjsp/MenuSystem/CaseViewMS.j) but fail to include the second part (sp?casenum=G03519757) resulting in the link not working and making the recipient have to do the work of piecing the URL back together. And with some humongous URLs (and you've seen them) this can be quite an effort. Move this to your small cell phone in a bumping bus ride and this is next to impossible!</p>

<p> So this has spawned an entire industry most notably tinyurl.com and friends. But why? Why not instead simple think up a meaning few words to describe the link and make a proper anchor href. For example, the above is talking about a Clarity case number of G03519757. So that should be the link text. Viola you have <a href="http://gisclarifyweb.somewhere.com/eSupport/eSupportjsp/MenuSystem/CaseViewMS.jsp?casenum=G03519757">G03519757</a>. This magic is achieved in Thunderbird - my mailer of choice - simply by highlighting the link text, typing Ctrl-L for link and pasting in the proper URL (In Outlock you select <b>Insert: Hyperlink</b>). There! You're done. Was that <b>that</b> hard? You've not only made it much easier on the receiver of your email by providing a simple - and attractive - link that will not break by being wrapped by any email client capable of rendering HTML (i.e. most of them) and for any incapable, they'll see the link in all its ugly glory and improper and broken wrapping they they must be accustomed to by now anyway!</p>

<p>So why don't people do this regularly? I'm not sure but my guesses run neck and neck between lazy and ignorant. What's your guess?</p>

<p>Why is it that organizations use Outlook at all? And then when they do they have their address books set up for &lt;lastname>, &lt;firstname>? That's not how I think of people - by their last name first! And to add injury to insult, often looking up people as &lt;firstname> &lt;lastname> fails!</p>

<p>I use Thunderbird and one of the first things I set up is an LDAP directory in the address book for the organization. Often this involves getting the secret LDAP info like server name and most importantly baseDN. Surprisingly I have been successful in getting this information most of the time! Once connected I have access to that elusive Outlook Global Address Book because essentially it's just and LDAP implementation. And my &lt;firstname> &lt;lastname> searches automagically start working directly in Thunderbird. Yippie!</p>

<p>Still there are broken search tools like SameTime's Add New Contact dialog which fails if you &lt;firstname &lt;lastname> search. Coupled with organizations propensity to use &lt;lastname>, &lt;firstname> is "Jessie Scott" "Jessie Scott" or "Scott Jessie"?</p>

                        <h3 class="entry-header">Security for your own good</h3>
                        <div class="entry-content">
                           <div class="entry-body">
                              <p>I wrote this in response to a Slashdot article about the recent home grown terrorist activity of that guy flying his plane into the IRS building regarding is perceived unfairness of Section 1706 of the IRS code that removes the safe harbor provisions of Section 530 - <a href="http://news.slashdot.org/story/10/02/21/1353223/Our-Low-Tech-Tax-Code">Our Low-Tech Tax Code</a>. In my opinion this guy was over the edge in FUD, interpreting the IRS's actions as making him a "criminal and non-citizen slave" - he was in full control of his life and how much success he could muster. But I see an alarming trend of the government either directly or indirectly "protecting" us from ourselves. Where's the opt out selection for this?</p>

<hr>

<p>I don't know about you but I'm getting really tired of other people "protecting" me and treating me like a person who cannot protect nor fend for myself. I enter into relationships of my own choosing - of my own volition. But my government doesn't trust that I can make the right decision for myself and must force me to do what they think is right at the point of a gun. Didn't we used to overthrow such tyrants? Perhaps it's time to do so again!</p>

<p>If I wish to perform contract work for a client for years and at pretty handsome rate and I must then get my own benefits, to pick and choose those that I want and not get those which I determine I don't want, if I am happy with such a relationship then isn't it I who have voluntarily chosen to engage in such a relationship?!? If the government still wishes to steal my hard earned earnings in the form of taxation and they don't believe I'm paying my "fair share" then that is an issue between my government and me - not an issue between my government and my customers/clients. Take me to tax court if you must and I will show you I am complying with your silly rules for membership in the Socialist States of America.</p>

<p>What happened to the thought that we should limit the abuse of forceful power that the government wields against our lives in the forms of such laws? Unlike the government, private business does not hold a gun to my head to force me to work for them. If they did, then that, and that alone, is the proper place for government to step in and protect my rights which are being violated <b>against my will in a non-voluntary fashion</b>. Now government implements this abuse of power indirectly by forcing private business to comply with legislation designed to protect me, even against my protestations to the contrary.</p>

<p>We see this in spades by private businesses asking all of these security questions that provide no real security, and collecting even more personal information, thus making identity theft even more likely, all in the name of 9/11 and the Patriot Act and "for my protection" as they say. But what if I don't want such protection or if I feel such protection is actually counter-intuitive or that it provide less security because now the identity thieves have a much more convenient target - your cell phone company's computer systems (and don't tell me you haven't heard of such theft of that information).</p>

<p>Lord please stop my government from forcing me to protect myself from that which I've voluntarily decided I do not wish to be protected from? IOW if you need me to sign a release I will gladly do it but stop forcing me to live my life as you see fit! It used to be that such an ideal was esteemed in this country but not it seems to be reviled! Why?!?</p>

                              <p>Latest story - like I said, I still don't have proper Samba access to mount vobs. I put in a ticket stating "I cannot log into Unix machines and I do not have access to Unix shares that I need for my work". I have managed to get a Unix account created. But I need to be added to the proper netgroup.</p>

<p>So the tech closes my ticket. I reopen it stating "I still can't log in so this issue has not been resolved". He closes it stating that "Well you need the netgroup - go here to request that. There's nothing for us to do so I'll close this ticket again". I reopen it stating "Until and unless I can log into Unix machines and access Unix shares this ticket is not resolved". Again he closes it.</p>

<p>So I give him an analogy - I tell him if I go to the car dealership to have my brakes done and I get a call from the service manager saying my request is completed only to come to the dealership and be presented with a piece of paper telling me how I can request brake pads I'd be fucking pissed! It's not my job to pick the store where you'll purchase brake pads for my brake job! It's the responsibility of the auto mechanic or the dealership to resolved that!!! IOW it's part of the job and you should not involve nor expect the customer (i.e. me) to have to deal with this issue.</p>

<p>He states he understands but he's just following SOP. I tell him "Well then the process is broken and should be fixed".</p>

<p>You see I'm struggling to understand why the support process is so horrible at such corporations. We would not accept such "service" from our auto mechanic, plumber, etc. - why do we tolerate it from our helpdesk team?</p>

                        <h3 class="entry-header">First few days at GE - AKA: How broken processes can get?</h3>
                        <div class="entry-content">
                           <div class="entry-body">
                              <p>After being here a few days and working through the various set up processes and the frustration involved with that I feel compelled to rant a little to blow off some steam. How do processes get this broken? It can't be just "Management by MS Office" as there are now web components entered into the mix of unneeded and unnecessarily redundant processes (pun intended)!</p>

<p>OK so I'm signing up for access to the Unix shares and machines so I can use Clearcase. I need to use Clearcase! I mean I'm the Clearcase admin right?. So first off there's a process, and process documentation to go through - a 4 Meg 70 page process! And the step by step guide is, of course, old and wrong. Muddling trough I submit a ticket to some support group...</p>

<p>Gripe 1: Why do I need to provide all kinds of information for this simple request? IOW Why isn't a simple one "I need Clearcase access to X" sufficient! Oh well. Rule - keep things simple.</p>

<p>So I get an email with yet another 8 step procedure that I must complete to get this access. Plus the way they describe it - Go here, click there, put your username here, search for this, select that - for most users (what if I'm not most users? How would I know if I'm an exception)? Etc. Then submit to <b>start</b> the process!</p>

<blockquote><p>Ah I see a problem here, they tell me to go to this page and search for that then I'm presented another page. Why not give me the link to that other page? Well because the web programmer didn't program it such that it has a unique URL. Bad design!</p></blockquote>

<p>Gripe 2 : Why must I follow various individualized steps? If I must fill in certain fields certain ways, why not give me a link that fills them in for me? Reduce the steps! Never tell the user to go to a web page then start clicking to go to yet other web sites - just point them to their final destination!</p>

<p>Gripe 3: What do you mean <b>start</b> the process?!? I started the process last step. Aren't we <b>in process</b>?!?</p>

<p>Gripe 4: Waiting. Where possible eliminate user wait time! This is the 21st century! Wait times of over a few nanoseconds shouldn't be there. Now I know sometimes you need to get "approval" of the boss or whatever but make it quick.</p>

<p>Gripe 5: After we complete this we get more instructions?!? You're kidding right?</p>

<p>Gripe 6: <b>Never</b> send email that does not have a proper reply to address. Doing so assumes your communication is perfect. It's not!</p>
