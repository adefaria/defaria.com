Sent from EXPLORE the BAY<br>
Kindly delete my pic pls</p>

<p><a href="http://www.meetup.com/members/10426135/">Andrew DeFaria</a> 7:19 AM</p>
<p>OK. Sorry. Didn't mean to "steal your soul"...</p>

<p><a href="http://www.meetup.com/members/188262992/">Lalaine</a> 7:31 AM</p></p>

<p>The picture is not a good thing to display buz it looks like I was annoyed with you or with the event, but I was not. I was just caught off guard.</p>

<p>If the pic did not show that kind of expression, then I would not mind nor would I request that you delete it. I wish you had asked my permission first when posting this 'kind' of picture. The concern is, not only it got posted and it's in everyone's emails, which such picture can be misjudged.</p>

<p>Please also ensure to delete every copy of this in your mobile gallery or any postings you've made on other sites (if any...). I trust that you'd respect my wishes. Thank you and have a good day.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.meetup.com/members/10426135/">Andrew DeFaria</a> 8:14 AM</p>

<p>But you were annoyed at me for taking that picture. That's why you looked that way.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.meetup.com/members/188262992/">Lalaine</a> 8:31 AM</p>

<p>I was not annoyed. Pls reread my email, I was caught off guard. I did still talk with you even after - remember? Did you see any annoyance in that. You've joined us quite a few times after and I was still talking with you cordially. My attitude did not change. Besides, I did not know that you actually took it cuz I started walking away and did not expect that you would post it either - if you did take it. I assumed wrong. I'm not comfortable when men are taking a 'solo' pic of me and esp a stolen pic. Yeah, it made me so uncomfortable that's why I showed that expression... Hope it does not happen again.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.meetup.com/members/10426135/">Andrew DeFaria</a> 8:47 AM</p>

<p>What I said was exactly and literally true. You were annoyed at me - <b>for taking that picture</b>. Not you were annoyed at me personally and would never speak to me again. You just didn't like that I took that picture. That's all I was saying. And it was why I still talked to you and hung out with you. I found you "exotic" and lovely which is why I took the picture. I thought you were a bit pouty in the picture but I thought it looked cute nonetheless so I posted it. Sorry it bothered you. I removed it and I can assure you I will take no more pictures of you.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.meetup.com/members/188262992/">Lalaine</a> 9:51 AM</p>

<p>I was just really uncomfortable. I find it rather odd. See, I had bad experiences from a few men before who stalked me. A while back I had to file unwanted harassment even at work and it all started by men taking a stolen solo pic of me. I'm not saying ur gonna be like that, but I'm traumatized...   We can all take pics in a group. Thanks for the compliments. God bless.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.meetup.com/members/10426135/">Andrew DeFaria</a> 9:55 AM</p>

<p>Thanks for thinking of me as a stalker first before thinking of me as just a nice man. Made me day!</p>

<hr>

<p>The bitch then proceeded to attempt to get me thrown out of the group. My opinion: Seems like she's has issues and should not be approached. Smells like a Fatal Attraction to me. Beware!</p>
