                                        <p>I think it's odd that most recruiters do not seem to know what they essential
duties are. Just looking at it quickly one would think that a recruiter's job
is to find <strong>qualified</strong> candidates. In the field of computers
this often means looking at buzzwords and matching them up. But it's more than
buzzword matching (http://jobscan.co can do that for you). It's really knowing
the technologies behind the buzzwords to know that, for example, <a 
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenkins_(software)">Jenkins</a> is
essentially the same as <a 
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_Cloud">Electric Commander</a>
whereas <a href="https://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a> is not really at all like
<a href="https://www.mongodb.com/">MongoDB</a> though they do share the characteristic of both being databases, 
one uses SQL and the other is No SQL.</p>

<p>I get way too many "offers" by recruiters - typically Indian recruiters -
for positions that I would have thought I was not qualified for. For example,
the client will say that 3+ years experience with AWS is <strong>required</strong>
and I do not have any AWS experience yet (I've played around with it at home
and have taken some online courses but it's clear the client wants 3+ years
of actual experience not classroom experience). But the recruiter will 
contact me nonetheless. Or a recruiter will approach me for a Salesforce
developer job. The word Salesforce appeared on my resume once. I helped the
Salesforce team integrate into JIRA via a plugin. I configured the plugin and
verified that Salesforce was talking to JIRA. I did absolutely nothing in
Salesforce itself. I would think that a Salesforce developer would know
Salesforce in depth. This is a waste of my time and their time and really
a waste of the client's time.</p>

<p>I realize that the recruiter may be thinking "Hey, I'm not sure that this
particular guy is totally qualified but I do see Salesforce on his resume. 
I'll reach out to him and ask questions". Then I would think he email, rather
than being just a form email, would be something like this:</p>

<blockquote>
Hi, my name is &lt;name&gt;. I saw your resume says you've had some Salesforce
exposure but it's not clear to me how much experience you actually have. I have
a Salesforce developer position described below. Can you tell me if you have
enough experience and if you are comfortable with the job requirements?...
</blockquote>

<p>But they don't do that.</p>

<p>I have toyed with the idea of faking experience so as to compel the 
recruiter to get me an interview and then go in there and simply say 
"I don't know any of that stuff and I don't know what Mr. Recruiter said I
did" just to discredit the recruiter to show their clients that this
particular recruiter is not properly screening (or screening at all for that
matter). Something needs to be done, IMHO!</p>

<p>Case in point: Working with one <a 
href="mailto:arvind.alagapalli@araucariatechnologies.com">Arvind Kumar</a> 
of <a href="http://araucariatechnologies.com">Araucaria Technologies</a>,
he approached me for an AWS Cloud Engineer position that has the following:</p>

<blockquote>
<h2>Qualifications:</h2>

<ul>
  <li>5+ years of progressive experience with large, complex information systems</li>
  <li>3+ years of experience provisioning, operating, and managing AWS 3+ environments</li>
  <li>Vast experience with transitioning physical plant to AWS environments</li>
  <li>Must have strong LAMP & Tomcat Java experience.</li>
  <li>Experience in automation and testing via scripting/programming.</li>
  <li>Strong experience with Ansible. Experience with SVN and Github (preferred)</li>
  <li>B.S. in Computer Science or equivalent (preferred)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Yet nowhere on my <a href="http://clearscm.com/resume">resume</a> would
you find 3_ years of AWS experience, nor transitioning physical plant to AWS environment. Have no experience with
Ansible, nor SVN or Github. This is not to say I couldn't excel at these
technologies as I pick up things quickly. And I do have experience with
things like Clearcase, Perforce and git (just not Github or SVN). And I have
taken some AWS courses but I would not claim to have 3+ years of experience
or even 1 year of experience because my experience is at home, not at a client's
site in a production situation.</p>

<p>As a result, why would anybody trust Arvind's word at all? Why would 
anybody work with Arvind or other recruiters at Araucaria Technologies knowing
that their quality control is very sub par?</p>

<p>Recently I found this Tech Recruiter job on DICE. Some of the essential 
duties include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Identify the client's business and cultural nuances, as well as define 
  the position, its functions, challenges selling points, and viability. 
  <b><u>Uncover the necessary knowledge, skills and abilities of the ideal 
  candidate</u></b>.</li>

  <li>Coordinate with Program Managers and Account Managers to <b><u>ensure quality delivery to client's requisitions</u></b>. Work with sales team 
  on account development and account management.</li>

  <li>Actively market <b><u>qualified candidates</u></b> to new and existing
  clients. Utilize sales techniques to expand business through research and 
  prospecting and turning client inquiries into job requisitions.</li>

  <li>Assist with the design of a sourcing strategy to uncover both passive 
  and active candidates through existing and new sources in order to 
  maintain an <b><u>effective pool of candidates</u></b>. Utilize 
  electronic process in recruiting and placement to <b><u>maximize 
  efficiency and time saving</u></b>.</li>

  <li><b><u>Target the most qualified candidates and screen resumes to
  identify potential matches</u></b>.</li>

  <li>Present opportunity to candidate and conduct in-depth interview to 
  <b><u>determine suitability and interest of candidate. Identify, evaluate,
  and summarize relevant technical experience, knowledge, hard and soft 
  skills, and abilities in relation to job requirements</u></b>.</li>

  <li><b><u>Submit qualified candidates</u></b> and respond to client 
  concerns.</li>
</ul>

<p>So as you can see recruiters should be qualifying people 
before emailing candidate who incompetent recruiters such as Arvind
obviously have not qualified.</p>
