<blockquote type=cite> Why is it people (in my case, women) have to play head games? I asked this gal out she said she would like to. But, has been putting it off. I notice she wasn't at the office the past 2 days, asked someone where she was. They told me Michigan to visit a guy she met on the net. I mean really if they are not interested just say so. Don't lead a person on. Going through this divorce is bad enough. And to beat all she is going through a divorce also trying to finalize it.<br />
</blockquote></p>

<p>Either two things: 1) she was just trying to be nice or doesn't know how to say no (a lot of women either do not know how to say no* or, in general, do not tend to say what they want or mean. Weird I know, especially since these same women often try to claim some sort of superior position in the art of communicating!) or 2) you're her #2 in case #1, the Michigan guy, doesn't work out. In any event she (and you) don't sound like either of you are on any stable ground to date anyway. Forget her if she's not interested. If she is interested she'll come around. If she doesn't well then you don't need the grief if you ask me...</p>

<blockquote>* Which lead me to a quote that I made up based on many enounters with women being "polite" and putting off a date when it really was that they were not interested. The quote is: "It occurs to me that if women really want men to know that no means no then it is encumbent on them to, once in a while, <b>SAY IT!</b>".</blockquote>

<blockquote type=cite>The loneliness is a killer. Just want some companionship, dinner, what ever some somebody to talk to and have a good time. </blockquote>

<p>Have you tried same sex friends? If not, why not?</p>

<blockquote type=cite> I am ready to move on. </blockquote>

<p>WRT the lady you mentioned, yes, move on. If she's not interested in you then it's <b>her</b> loss.</p>

<blockquote type=cite> What is anyone's opinion on personals on Yahoo and other sites.</blockquote>

<p>I had a friend who firmly believed that all personal sites should have an entrance way with a sign: "Abandon hope all ye that enter". I didn't think so at the time. I do now.</p>

<blockquote type=cite> I am in engineering and work, workout at a gym and that is about it.</blockquote>

<p>Ask yourself this question: What would make somebody interested in you? So you work out and do engineering. Therefore you are looking for a woman who's either into engineering (good luck!) or working out (also good luck!). Tell me, what do you do for fun? What are your hobbies and passions? Persue them. Meet other people who have similar interests. Hang out with them. Hang out with other guys who have interests like you do (why is it after we get past our 20's or so that when we think of going out to have fun it is usually the thought of going out on a date with a member of the opposite sex and we give up going out with our same sex friends). Make yourself busy on yourself doing things you like to do and that makes you feel good. Do not worry about finding a love. Right now it doesn't seem like even you like yourself, how can you expect others to be interested.</p>

<blockquote>Another aside, as another 40 something, recently divorced (or in the process), also into engineering but doesn't work out, perhaps we could get together! I could use somebody as a work out buddy, especially somebody who knows what they are doing, to kick me into going to the gym and getting rid of this excess fat that seems to come with divorce and depression. Actually exercise is good not only to drop wait but to get energy and to combat depression, never mind gets you out of the house and gives you something to do. If interested email me...</blockquote>

<p>In the process you will feel good about yourself and not need anybody else. When you get to that place you'll have a chance at finding somebody else that wants to share there life with you and that you want to share your life with them, because you both will be complete whole people, rather than dating losers to pour your sorrows to and to listen to their sorrows, saying that you're not looking for a relationship or a one night stand, but wishing that that would happen.</p>

<blockquote type=cite>How else do you meet people anymore? I am in my mid 40's. I am descent, respectful and know how to treat a lady. Do they want this any more? Some people say no you can treat women to nice and they will walk all over you. That happened in my marriage.</blockquote>

<p>It depends largely on the caliber of women that you meet. At your age, as they say, most of the good ones are taken, and for good reason! After all they are the good ones! The ones that are floating around are either divorced (often for good reason too) or never been married (also for good reason). IOW they are often (but not always) single because they are not a good one (or else they would be married). Rarely is one person a saint and the other a sinner when a marriage fails. It takes two to tango and it takes two to mess up a relationship. So our selection is bad to start with.</p>

<p>As I said, work on yourself. Make yourself a better, more interesting, fun person. Do not concern yourself with "mating" either sexually, physically or emotionally. There is so much to do as a single person that can be fun and freeing. Free yourself and explore yourself. If and when you become a person who is interesting, fun, confident, etc you'll probably feel that you have little or no need to "mate", sexually, physically or emotionally* - hell you're fun even to yourself. However people do like being with other people, other special people. So while your out having fun, doing what you do best, look for others who are doing the same, others of the opposite sex with the same "single and loving it" attitude and approach them.</p>

<blockquote>* Actually I've found in my life that it is either when you are scraping the bottom in the throws of depression and loneliness or at the top of your game that humans tend to have a need to be intimately involved with another human being. When at the bottom the need is to "save" you from your depression, loneliness and need - IOW for all the wrong reasons. When you're at the top of your game you also exprience a need to share all of your good fortune with another - IOW for all the right reasons.</blockquote>

<blockquote type=cite> Just tired of being alone.</blockquote>

<p>So am I. If only I could implement what I espouse (hmmm... interesting word there...), however I'm just not ready to go down that path yet, soon, but not just right now. Perhaps you're in a similar situation. Fine. Just remember the goal and the path to get there. Implement it when you can.<br />
