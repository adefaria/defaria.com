                              <p>I had a phone interview with IBM today. The job is over at the Research Center, which is pretty cool because it would be like working at HP Labs and the commute would be wornderfull. Unfortunately it's a Windows position and it seems like it involves a bunch of scientists with regengrade PC's and trying get them all in line with the corporate network so that they can access Clearcase and Clearquest. Also, the pay is pretty bad - only $40/hour at a 1099 rate which would mean that I would not have benefits. Effectively a net loss. The contract is for 9 months but there is a possbility that I could be hired. Not sure what to do as Salira seems to be doing fairly well. We have funding for about 4-5 months and there's talks and rumors of a partnership with Lucent.</p>
