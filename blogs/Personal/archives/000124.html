                              <p>The other day I met a neighbor in my apt complex while washing clothes. Her name is Robin. I mentioned I used to work at HP and so did she. She seemed to perk up at that and become interested. She's been laid off for some 18 months now. Found out she's in QA and told her I'd ask if we needed anybody.</p>

<p>Then on a Friday she stops by my place and rings the doorbell. I couldn't fathom who would be ringing my doorbell, I have very few visitors. Danni was over and in bed and I was just in crappy clothes hacking away at my computer. Well I opened the door and there's Robin standing there in a dress and holding a couple of roses. It was apparent to me that she was probably returning from a date. I was quite surprised to see her. She said she just wanted to say hi. Well I must of have given her the impression that I didn't want to be bothered - I didn't or rather I didn't expect any company - and she shortly left to go home. I thought odd, however she's probably just interested in me trying to get her into Salira. I think she's living with some guy...</p>

<p>Today I asked Asad and he said that we were indeed looking for somebody, so I stopped by Robin's apt to see if she had a resume. She has a little boy and some guy "roommate". I just assume he's her boyfriend. I ring the doorbell and I hear a man's voice from the other side. "What do you want?" he asks. I say "Is Robin there?". "Who is it?" he asks. I say "Andrew". Robin opens the door and let's me in.</p>

<p>I tell her that my company is looking for people and ask if she has a resume. She has like 6 computers - impressive setup. Eventually she gives me a diskette with her resume. The whole time the guy friend is noticably missing, retreating to some back room I guess.</p>

<p>As I'm leaving Robin goes to the doorway and says that I can come over anytime and sort of perks up her face puckering her lips! What? Well I'm just not into nor ready for anything like this so I just leave. Some people are just strange!</p>
