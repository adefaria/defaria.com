Andrew,</p>

<p>Been a few days and I thought I would drop you a line.  How are things going?  Are you enjoying the weather?  I have been down with a cold - still
coming into to work but it is dragging me down.  Luckily I have not had to get
too close to anyone.  A number of other people have been staying  ome.</p>

<p>Sorry, I saw you're message this morning but I had cardiac rehab today
then went out for lunch with my brother. Then I got sleepy...;-)</p>

<p>Hell, I get to take naps now so I took advantage of that!</p>

<p>I'm still doing good. Like I said I'm doing cardiac rehab. Did a 2 hour
walk at Whiterock Lake Tuesday. I think that might have been a bit much
though as I got a cramping like pain under my left rib cage. The pain
has been moving around my chest a little bit. The nurses at cardiac
rehab said I may have done just a little to much and to take it a
little easier so I am. They said there's a lot of nerves and tissue
that are banged around and traumatized from the surgery and sometimes
people feel such pains for a while.</p>

<p>Did you get to see your doctor this week?  Did he give you a “go back to work” pass?  A week from next Monday is 6<sup>th</sup>.  Will be good to have you back.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I saw the surgeon last Monday. He just checked out his handiwork and
asked how I was doing. I asked him what he saw when he was in there. He
didn't seem to have a very good "bedside manner" nor was he that
talkative. He said they just went straight to the heart to do what was
necessary. I asked him if my arteries were constricted. He said yes, as
he expected. He told me to keep cleaning the incision and applying the
cream they gave me. I asked him if it were true that bypasses last only
10-15 years and is my best shot to just try to be as healthy as I
could. He said yes that was the best I can do and didn't really put a
length on how long a bypass will last.</p>

<p>All in all I got the impression that surgeons only care and know much
about the surgery itself. Sorta like asking the break repairmen if my
car will perform better and him answering "Well you'll stop better!".</p>

<p>I see my cardiologist on Monday. I'm getting the impression that the
cardiologist is <i>the man</i> when it comes to after surgery advice.
For example, I haven't had my cholesterol checked and I'm curious what
it has come down to with me taking cholesterol medicine for a month
now. I suspect also that the cardiologist is also the man with both the
<i>back to work pass</i> and the <i>now you can drive</i> pass. I
don't know what I'm gonna do when my brother leaves Saturday and I need
to go to say the grocery store if I'm still not allowed to drive.</p>
