                              <p>Was trying to get all of my WebSAM testing completed but was not able to. Got kicked onto another test system and that one had problems. Luckily Asad and Jeff helped fix things up for me. Got a lot done but may need to do more tomorrow.</p>

<h3>2.3.0.4 releaseed</h3>

<p>2.3.0.4 bring in the FX branch into the 2.3 release line. It also has fairly major functionality identified by bug ID 3605 (287 elements changed!) and a new card, onu2311.</p>

<p>Please let me know when you guys and gals make a new card! While updating the makefile will indeed insure that the new card is build when one types make, I use scripts and processes that rely on the definition of <i>cards</i> defined in /Tools/adm/etc/cards and need to update that file when a new card appears. Thanks.</p>

<p>Regarding the FX branch: The FX branch was a temporary branch for engineers to work on until 2.3 stablized. As such, with it's successful merge I plan on <font color="red"><b>destroying</b></font> both us_fx and china_fx branches. A destroy means that <i>the branch, element versions on that branches,  any labels on those element versions and merge arrows to and from the FX branches will <b>disappear</b></i>. It will be as if suddenly a bunch of new FX related code got checked into the 2.3 release line. Since the FX branch was indeed temporary I don't see any problem with destroying it though. Let me know if you have any objection to this.</p>

<p>Before I destroy the FX branches however Hok has to check in his code and merge it to 2.4.</p>
