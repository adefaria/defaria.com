                              <p>OK, licenses are all OK now. BTW hostid is not a combination of IP address and MAC address - it's simply MAC address of the NIC card. Problem appears to be that during the server move the NIC card changed! I verified this with the Rational rep this morning. The current MAC address of the NIC card as shown by ipconfig /all (it's the Physical Address) is 00-0f-20-6d-09-97. I gave the old license strings to the rep and she determined our old MAC address of the NIC card was 00-0b-cd-9b-f4-27.</p>

<p>Looking at the Device Manager on the servers I notice that we have two Network Adapters listed:</p>

<ol>
  <li>HP NC7781 Gigabit Server Adapter</li>
  <li>HP NC7781 Gigabit Server Adapter #2</li>
</ol>

<p>Why we have 2 NIC cards I don't know (perhaps merely for the ability to be multihomed). Normally I see #1 being disabled and #2 being enabled. Rtnlprod01 is like this. Rtnlprod02 has #1 enabled and #2 disabled. For the vob and view servers this does not matter. Either card will work. For rtnlprod03 however, since licenses are tied to the NIC card's MAC address, switching from #1 -> #2 (or #2 -> #1 as I suspect has happened here) will invalidate all licenses. We need to insure that the network adapter for rtnlprod03 remains nailed at either #1 or #2.</p>

<p>Since it appears that the network adapter has changed and since I have obtained a new set of licenses for this new network adapter and still have the old set, I have installed both sets so that in the event that the network adapter switches again we'll be covered. However, if we order additional licenses for say card #1 and somehow we get switched to card #2, those additional licenses will not be represented, hence the desire to nail the NIC card to either one or the other.</p>
