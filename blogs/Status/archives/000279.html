                              <h3>Rebuilding of cross toolchain from 120604-B</h3>

<p>After building LynxOS 120604-B and only receiving a few errors about (see previous days entry) I decided to attempt to rebuild the toolchain again. This seemed to work OK!</p>

<h3>Building LynxOS 120604-C</h3>

<p>With the toolchain rebuilt I went to rebuild LynxOS 120604-C. At this point Dopey ran out of disk space. I moved the 120604-A subdirectory over to /export/build2/defaria temporarily because that filesystem had much more space.</p>

<h3>Toolchain tarball naming change</h3>

<h4>AKA, why one should always cvs checkout int_tools instead of just copying it</h4>

<p>There's been this nagging problem of int_tools not being able to find the proper toolchain tarball to install compilers. This we due to the fact that I've been copying int_tools from 120604-A -> 120604-B -> 120406-C. Well names have changed but the copies of int_tools didn't reflect that change! Plus, for some reason, somebody hand fixed 120604-B but 120604-C and -A had been refreshed from CVS. Moral of this story is to always use cvs checkout to get a fresh copy of int_tools.</p>

<div class="note">
  <p><b>Note:</b> This underscores one of the things that I do not like in CVS, that being the tendency of making many copies of what's in CVS due to it's snapshot view/sandbox like methodology. It's easy to see where one might create a 120604-C/int_tools directory via a cvs checkout int_tools and that int_tools be different than 120604-B and 120604-C's copies. If one then needs to make a change to int_tools and this change should apply to the -B and -C areas as well then one needs to remember about the -B and -C areas and remember to update them as well. This is a common problem with a snapshot/sandbox philosophy. Nevermind that it's wasteful to have so many multiple copies of essentially the same thing - wasteful in terms of diskspace and prone to misunderstanding and human error.</p>
