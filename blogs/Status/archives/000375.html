                              <h3>Rock (Solaris) build</h3>

<p>Building on Rock is building on Solaris. We have to rebuild parts of the cdk by cd'ing into src/cdk and doing make install. This puts stuff into the cdk/<host>-[xcoff|elf]-<target> area. Now on Linux everything builds OK and I believe we also did the Window portion too. But Solaris was yet undone.</p>

<p>Turns out that not much builds successfully on Solaris but all that is required at this time is mkimage. With mkimage successfully built the process of building LOS178 on Solaria remains largely the same in that you checkout/export the sources and untar the ppc.cdksol.tar.gz. The difference is that you inject your newly built mkimage into the cdk area before building.</p>

<h3>Packaging and Structuring</h3>

<p>Vinnie attempted to describe the packaging structuring. I'm still not sure i have it all in my head yet but here goes:</p>

<p>Note that we are only currently building for release on Rock or Solaris. Still cdk's for other targets need to be built and included. Also, we use the bin-image/ppc.cdk<host>.tar.gz prebuilt software for building things and we also package up cdk tarballs in the release area (e.g. 2011-01.cdksol.tar.gz).</p>

<p>For GDB we must source SETUP.bash pointing to some LOS178 area and then we go to the toolchain and make install-gdb. The end result of this build are two executables, one of which we are concerned with - gdbserver. However there are also various things deposited in the cdk for gdb, the client and for insight and Tcl/Tk stuff.</p>

<p>The gdbserver and it's client require packaging of Linux, Windows and Solaris cdk's that contain the necessary gdb parts. The current package.sh should automatically handle this because it packages up things based on directory names.</p>
