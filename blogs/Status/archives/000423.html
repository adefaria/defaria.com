                              <h3>Evil Twin Trigger</h3>

<p>Evil twins are a well known phenomena in Clearcase circles. It is not recommended that you try to stop them by convention rather by Clearcase trigger. I have a trigger that does just that. The code uses cleartool ls so that it works for both dynamic views and snapshot views. The trigger also respects case sensitivity. This means that creating an element named "foo" and another element named "Foo" is allowed.</p>

<p>Evil twins should not be allowed in any vob because, as you rightly point out, it causes merging problems.</p>

<p>Shall I add this trigger to all vobs?</p>

<h3>Performance Scripts</h3>

<p>Both Philip and Chin have their own Clearcase performance testing scripts. In general performance of Clearcase is a huge topic. These scripts a relatively simple, just timing some basic Clearcase operations. Still this is a good metric from a user's perspective.</p>

<p>We should consolidate these tests and make them more flexible by having them self contained (both creating and tearing down the environment that they need) and generalize them so that new Clearcase operations can be easily added and timed.</p>

<p>These scripts should produce a data file that can be later consumed by say a PHP script to present the results in a readable manner on a web page somewhere.</p>

<p>Also, these scripts need to set up various different environments such as using local/remote snapshot views, dynamic views. These scripts can be used to measure performance of the old (ccase-rmna-1) environment as well as newer environements (ccase-rmna-3 and/or the new Linux server).</p>

<p>Finally it should be made such at adding new tests, i.e. make new baseline, can easily be incorporated into the test suite.</p>
