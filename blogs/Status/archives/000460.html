                              <h2>PQA: Remaining Issues</h2>

<p>The following issues came up at this meeting:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Requirement to support old style Email Link's (See below)</li>

  <li>Update Production Web Server to latest Clearquest version (See below)</li>

  <li>Remaining data conversion issues (Emailed Vinh asking for details)</li>

  <li>Dynamic List cleanup (Emailed Vinh asking for updates)</li>

  <li>Test DB hand off (Emailed Vinh pointing to backups of my converted database for him to test)</li>
</ol>

<p>Vinh provided an example: http://extranet.broadcom.com/cqweb/url/default.asp?id=Prod00014218. There are several problems with this. First the default.asp indicates an IIS server and an ASP web application. The new version of RWP is not IIS based rather it is Apache based. I cannot find a default.asp in RWP at all. Thus the above style link will not work.</p>

<p>Vinh says that he generates through hooks in CQ. I suspect what is happening is this: When a defect changes state action hooks kick in and determine it's time to send email to notify the appropriate people that a change in state has happened. At this time Vinh's hooks change/generate these links. As such Vinh needs to change his hooks to generate new URLs that conform to the new Clearquest software. One question I have is how did Vinh come up with http://<servername>/url/default.asp?id=<ID> as a syntactical template meaning "Show this specific defect"? I cannot find where this is documented.</p>

<p>I tried http://p4test/url/default.asp?id=<ID> on p4test and that doesn't work. Perhaps this is just an issue of figuring out what the correct URL template is and changing the hook. The hook could also be modified to perhaps add links for http://<server>/<path>/<script>?old_id=<ID> if that is possible. This would then take care of all future emailed URL's. I'm not sure how to account for old emails that may have now invalid links.</p>

<p>I did see that the new Web interface has a Email Defect link which produces URLs of the form: http://p4test/cqweb/main?command=GenerateMainFrame&service=CQ&schema=2005.02.00&contextid=Cont&entityID=33580034&entityDefName=Defect</p>

<p>(Decidedly not user friendly).</p>

<p>The question remains whether or not to go with upgrading the production server to the newest version of Clearquest so we can get the new version of Clearquest Web. It is a different web interface. Ray is looking into getting another machine so we can have both new and old versions of Clearquest Web. One issue is that if we do go to the merged database and new Clearquest Web and run for a while then decide there is some critical flaw, going back to the old Web server will also mean going back to the old databases and losing any work done during the time we were on the new setup.</p>

<h2>Data Conversion Problems</h2>

<p>Vinh wrote:</p>

<blockquote type=cite>
  <p>by compare with Prod0009710, not match values for these</p>

  <ol>
    <li>SW Version</li>

    <li>Time From Resolve To Verify</li>

    <li>Closed Date</li>

<p># 1 was due to a bug - I fixed this.</p>

<p># 2 and 3 are due to the fact that these fields are set to readonly. The odd thing is that they do not appear to have any good. The question then is how do they obtain values? My guess is that these values are fielded in by some other sort of hook script at some time. My workaround is to add these to the list of fields that must be toggled to optional in order for the conversion to work and toggled back after the conversion. My fear is what other fields are like these?</p>

<p>The list of readonly fields in the schema are:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Fixed_In_Project</li>

  <li>Close_Date (Mentioned above)</li>

  <li>Submit_Date (Already toggled to optional)</li>

  <li>Submitter (Already toggled to optional)</li>

  <li>Notes_Log</li>

  <li>old_id (Already toggled to optional)</li>

  <li>TimeFromSubmitToVerify</li>

  <li>TimeToVerify (Time From Resolve To Verify mentioned above)</li>

  <li>Audit_Log (Already toggled to optional)</li>
</ol>

<p>My guess here is that the other fields (#1, 5 & 7 above) are also empty. The solution therefore it to toggle all readonly fields in the list above to optional before performing the merge.</p>
