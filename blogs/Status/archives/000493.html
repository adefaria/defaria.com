                              <h2>BinMerge updates</h2>

<p>Updated BinMerge to always draw the merge arrow to the branch we are merging to. There was also a bug about the choice returned from the PerlTk portion where it needed to not only be chomped but chopped until there were no more "\n"'s there. Don't know why that happened.</p>

<p>Additionally the PerlTk window would often not pop to the top of the window stack. This is apparenty common under Windows. I implemented the following code:</p>

<div class="code"><pre>
    # Make sure the window pops to the top
    # Trying really hard... :-)
    $main->update;
    $main->deiconify;
    $main->update;
    $main->raise;
    $main->update;
    $main->focusForce;
    $main->update;

    MainLoop;
</pre></div>

<p>At least this heavy handed approach seems to work.</p>

<h2>Stripmime and GNATS</h2>

<p>Ravi and I worked on the stripmimed thing a little today. Here's what
happened:</p>

<ul>
  <li>We verified that stripmimed is indeed running. The alias was changed to not run Perl first rather to  use the shebang line. That was working - IOW /tools/gnats/4.0/bin/stripmimed would run. (later it broke).</li>

  <li>We verified that stripmimed was writing properly to stdout.</li>

  <li>We saw that /tools/gnats/4.0/SunOS/libexec/gnats/queue-pr was being run and a file was being deposited into /tools/gnats/db-test-it/gnats-queue.</li>

  <li>We saw that /tools/gnats/4.0/SunOS/libexec/gnats/queue-pr would be run by cron (or by hand) and it would process the file deposited in the queue</li>

  <li>After that we don't know where the information for this went. We were using Test/1 in the subject line which should update http://gnats-irva-3.broadcom.com/cgi-bin/gnatsweb.pl?debug=&amp;database=IT-Test&amp;cmd=edit&amp;cmd=edit&amp;pr=1
but it isn't.</li>
</ul>

<p>I attempted to debug this further and I made a change /tools/gnats/4.0/bin/stripmimed and now:</p>

<div class="code"><pre>
gnats-irva-3:/tools/gnats/4.0/bin/stripmimed
/tools/gnats/4.0/bin/stripmimed: line 44: use: command not found
/tools/gnats/4.0/bin/stripmimed: line 48: use: command not found

</pre></div>

<p>So how did we fix the shebang problem before? Also, why is queue-pr not properly updating the pr? (My suspicion is that the file attachment on this PR is messing up queue-pr - nope, that doesn't seem to be it...</p>
