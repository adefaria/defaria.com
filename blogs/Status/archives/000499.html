<p>Rebasing is different than delivering. With Inter Project Deliver developers are "delivering" from one project to the next. This is not a real delivery as in delivering to the integration stream, rather it's a delivery from one project to another. What we have here is a hierarchy outside of the normal heirarchy supported by UCM.</p>

<p>Delivery between projects therefore is merely a findmerge and indeed the deliver command is not used. Rebasing, called <i>Rebase to parent</i>, however still uses the rebase command. This presents a problem in that rebase -preview -long does not operate the same way as findmerge -print. For one it does not do recursive directory merging like findmerge does (with findmerge we can capture and control the merging by using -print and handling the merging by ourselves). IBM/Rational designed deliver and rebase to be as automatic as possible. I suspect therefore that rebase automatically handles recursive directory merging thus not allowing you to do the recursive directory merging yourself.</p>

<p>"So fine" you say, "Just let rebase handle all of the directory merging". Well there is no way to do just directory merging and remember we want to capture and handle the file element merging ourselves so we can capture those instances where merge conflicts and binary merges exist, delaying them to the very end and handling the binary merge (or rebase) ourselves. With rebase we don't seem to have the same options as with findmerge and thus this may not be doable.</p>

<p>"OK, fine" you say again, "Skip the rebasing and just use findmerge". While that may be doable we will not have the "rebase in progress" behavior that they are currently accustomed to. That plus rebase opperates off of baselines and even recommendated baselines. We would need to figure out how that translates to labels that findmerge can use - and they'd need to be labels of possibly multiple components and the like. For now we are shelfing this BinRebase until we obtain more input...</p>
