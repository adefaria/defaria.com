                              <h2>Global File System Area - SCM</h2>

<p>I'm just trying to understand a little bit better about global paths, replication and DFS here at Broadcom. I ask because I see that this new SCM directory that I created over in Irvine is not at other sites as I would have expected it. For example:</p>

<div class="code"><pre>
ccase-rmna-3:ls -d /projects/ccase/SCM
ls: /projects/ccase/SCM: No such file or directory
ccase-rmna-3:ls /projects/ccase | wc -l
     17
</pre></div>

<p>and</p>

<div class="code"><pre>
ccase-sj1-1:ls -d /projects/ccase/SCM
ls: /projects/ccase/SCM: No such file or directory
ccase-sj1-1:ls /projects/ccase | wc -l
     16
</pre></div>

<p>However</p>

<div class="code"><pre>
x-irva-01:ls -d /projects/ccase/SCM                                           
/projects/ccase/SCM/
x-irva-01:ls /projects/ccase | wc -l                                          
      24
</pre></div>

<p>So then the SCM directory exists in Irvine but not in SJ nor Richmond. I suspect that it's merely that something needs to replicate it and maybe I just need to wait until that happens. Still such a delay in replication is a side effect we must bear in mind when we are pushing out changes... Also, notice the different directory counts at the three sites above...</p>

<p>WRT Windows and DFS, my Z drive is mapped to \\brcm-sj\dfs and I therefore do not have a Z:\projects\ccase\SCM directory there either:</p>

<div class="code"><pre>
Local:ls -d /dev/z/projects/ccase/SCM
ls: /dev/z/projects/ccase/SCM: No such file or directory
Local:ls /dev/z/projects/ccase | wc -l
16
</pre></div>

<p>I suspect this correlates to ccase-sj1-1:/projects/ccase/SCM and whenever that directory gets populated so will my Z drive.</p>

<p>Again, it might be that replication will eventually happen or that it need to be set up. But we must understand that pushing something to some "global" place in Irvine, SJ or Richmond has a built in prorogation delay.</p>

<p>Finally, it seems to me that the intent of the projects automount map is to provide a well known path to global file space that exists on filers at the various sites and that replication between the filers happens on some known schedule. Scripts or other processes should "reach out" to the filer storage area they they know (e.g. \\brcm-irv\dfs\projects\ccase...) rather they should use the automount map (i.e. /projects/ccase) so as to avoid having to go out on the WAN to get stuff. For Unix this is pretty simplified in that the automounter and the projects automount map normalizes this to just /projects/<project>/<etc>. But can it be said that the same is true under Windows for the Z drive and DFS? By that I mean can I rely on Z:\projects\ccase\SCM to be the right place? If so then I will change my Perl code to set $lib_path = "Z:\\projects\\ccase\\SCM\\lib".</p>
