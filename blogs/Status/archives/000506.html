                              <h2>Clearcase Modules</h2>

<p>It occurs to me that lots of repeatative Perl coding goes on with many people implementing functions for the same old commonly performed actions. For example, sending an email message, reading a file into an array and performing many Clearcase operations such as creating a view, checking to see if a view exists, mounting vobs, etc. I thought it's about time to have some Perl modules to offer these common tasks in a useful way. In particular, when writing log_activity I had to check to see if a particular view exists and create it if it doesn't, mount all the vobs, etc. Seems to me a set of Clearcase Perl modules would be useful to me, Broadcom and indeed others so I started coding them.</p>

<p>The idea here is to provide Perl objects for Clearcase objects that can be used and manipulated in a Perl manner. So a vob object would contain much of the registry information, in case you need it, as well as provide some common "actions" such a mount the vob represented by this object. The Vobs object would contain information about all vobs and things like itterrators and the like. A mount on a Vobs object would mean mount all vobs, etc. Similarly with a View object one could imagine methods such as exists which tells you if the view exists, create to create a view, remove to remove a view and so on.</p>

<p>Now these are not the only Clearcase oriented "objects" that need to be made into Perl objects nor do the current objects cover all of the access to the various functionality that they could - Clearcase is a huge system! But one must start somewhere...</p>

<p>Similarly I plan on making more modules for other things, like Utils.pm for things like reading in a whole file and returning an array or perhaps a string (wantarray would be useful here). The general idea is to start making more userful modules that are Perl like so that one can more quickly develop code and not slow themselves down reinventing the Perl wheel all the time. Combining this with hosting this code using CVS and my server should prove useful. The Clearcase object(s) may even be something that can be packaged up and perhaps put on CPAN (though I need to learn a lot more about things like POD and other things to make this comply better with any CPAN requirements), but all of this will be a "work in progress" for quite some time though. Remember though - "Every journey begins with the first step"...</p>
