                              <h2>Trail version of MobMM</h2>

<p>I've been working feverishly on your Clearquest database and have made some good progress. Following the Open Source motto of <i>Release Early, Release Often</i> I would like to have you take a look at what I have so far. Many things work. Some things have yet to be implemented. Play with it. Pay particular attention to stepping through the states and which fields are available for editing on the various tabs at various stages through the state transition matrix.</p>

<p>For now you can access this through http://p4test/cqweb/login then login as guest:guest and set the DB to MM. This is a test/play database so feel free to add, change or delete defects and other records.</p> 

<h3>Things that work</h3>

<p>The following things I have working:</p>

<ol>
  <li><b>Module/Submodule:</b> In order to implement this I needed 3 stateless records. One is the Module record which contains the module name, owner and a description field (use description for anything you'd like). Another stateless record is the Submodule record. Here we have only Submodule name and description. To tie these two things together I have a ModSub_XRef stateless record. It has a drop down for Modules (referencing the Module stateless record - IOW if you don't see a module name in the drop down then that's because you haven't added a record for it in the Module stateless record). Similarly there's a Submodule drop down (referencing the Submodule stateless record). The purpose of this ModSub_XRef stateless record is to tie together a module with a set of submodule(s). These two fields are concatenated together separated with a ":" to form the ModSub field which is set as the unique key for the record (Currently this ModSub field is shown when creating a ModSub_XRef record but eventually it will be hidden). Setting up modules and submodules then tying them together will be a setup kind of a thing. You may need to occasionally set up a new submodule or  module and make the ModSub_XRef record to tie things together.</p>

<p>The result is when you enter a defect you toggle the Module drop down and the Submodule gets populated correctly. Additionally you'll see that the Owner field gets set to Module.Owner automatically.</p></li>

  <li><b>Assigned Date:</b> Gets automatically set to the current date</li>

  <li><b>Visibility:</b> Gets set to "Broadcom Only" - no other values are available yet and this field is essentially read only at this time.</li>

  <li><b>Notes:</b> If you change the state of an Assigned defect to Resolved you'll need to fill out the Resolved tab. When the Resolved Note gets changed it is populated into the Notes field in the Notes tab. Similarly if you go to Verified, the Verified Notes field also populates the Notes field. If either Resolved Notes or Verified Notes are not yet specified then Note will say so.</li>

  <li><b>Audit Log:</b> Has been taken from PQA and implemented. As fields are changed the Audit Log is updated.</li>

  <li><b>Time From &lt;state&gt; to &lt;state&gt;</b>: On the Management tab there are the Time From... Assigned -&gt; Resolve and Assigned -&gt; Verified. When a defect goes to Resolved then the former is set. When a defect goes to Verified then the later is set. Time is in days. (Please note that it is possible to later modify the defect and change the Resolved Date. In such cases these Time From fields are <b>not</b> recalculated. Additionally there are currently no checks to insure that Verified_Date &gt; Resolved_Date, for example).</li>
</ol>

<h3>Things not yet working</h3>

<p>There are several things I have not yet implemented in this design. These are:</p>

<ol>
  <li><b>CC:</b> Although present in the Submission tab the CC list currently does nothing</li>

  <li><b>Changeset:</b> Listed on the Resolution tab Changeset is just a short string right now. I believe we need a multiline string down the road. This field is supposed to be filled in by a hook from CVS (IIRC) that will record the files and revisions. Ray you might want to look at what I did in SCM/cvsbin/cvsism and adapt it to Jean's Clearquest database. You can look at SCM/cq/pqamerge for examples of how to update Clearquest databases through Perl.</li>

  <li><b>Other  Notes:</b> Entering data here does not update the Notes field above it (yet).</li> 

  <li><b>Testcase ID &amp; Testplan Version:</b> Currently do nothing.</li>

  <li><b>Duplicate IDs, Related IDs and Notes: </b>On the Broadcom Notes tab also do nothing yet. The whole issue of how to hand Duplicate and Related IDs has not been designed. I think we should look into how IBM/Rational handles duplicates in it's default package and use that as well as change it to handle related ids too.</li>
</ol>

<p>Again, look for whatever you see as wrong: Process flow, spelling errors, alignment, move a field to a different form, add a field, whatever and let me know. You're input will be used for the next rendition of this.</p>

<p>You may want to eventually install Clearquest Client on your machine. You can follow the instructions at <a  href="http://intranet.broadcom.com/%7Eadefaria/Clearquest/CQ2003.06.14.php">
Installing 2003.06.15</a>. Those instructions were for PQA but installing Clearquest is the same for everybody. Do not continue on to the instructions for setting up your profile - the profile is specific to the different projects. I'll have to get a profile file set up for you later.</p>
