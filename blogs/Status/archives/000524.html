                              <h2>More MobMM Progress</h2>

<p>I have separated the MobMM design from the old PQA Schema Repository.
By being in it's own schema repository MobMM now has a separate, distinct set of user accounts. You really don't want PQA users being able to log into your database. This separation required essentially replicating all of my work over into this new schema repository.</p>

<p>The Schema Repository is called MobMM_Schema. The administrative user
for the database is MobMM_Admin with a password of ru4real. Normally nobody sees this username except people who are using MS/SQL Enterprise Manager to create databases or using the CQDesigner to create schemas, user databases, etc. IOW Jean, you wouldn't be using this user account but Ray and others will need that info.</p>

<p>There is, by default, and "admin" user that you can use to log into CQDesigner or Clearquest Client. Its password is also ru4real. Again, Jean, I don't think that you would be using this user account either, rather a CQDesigner would use it.</p>

<p>As we have a new user account database I had to create some users. There's admin and I made myself a user (adefaria). I also made user accounts for you Jean (jfan - password jfan - you can log in and change that - I would suggest your Windows domain password but that's just me) as well as the Module owners of Vinod Prasad (username: node; password: node), Rick Howarth (rhowarth:rhowarth), Chris Wilson (cswilson:cswilson) and Bhupesh Khawa (bhupesh:bhupesh).</p>

<h3>Work Performed</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Separated MobMM to its own Schema Repository</li>

  <li>Renamed MobileCom -&gt; MobMM</li>

  <li>Removed Visibility from submission form</li>

  <li>I've created all Modules and all Submodules but linked only some of them. A lot are owned by Vinod. Try entering a defect with a module of Display Manager and you should see Owner set to "node". Change that to OLG and it should switch to cswilson.</li>

  <li>Created users as defined above. Gave admin privileges to my userid</li>

  <li>Created Administrators, Managers and Users groups. My userid and admin are in all three groups. Jean, your user is in the Manager and Users group. Other users are just in the Users group.</li>

  <li>Gave Dynamic List Admin privileges to Jean and Vinod. This means that you can add/change/delete entries in dynamic lists (Select <b>Edit: Named Lists</b> to manage dynamic lists such as <i>Software_Version</i>)</li>

  <li>Populated Dynamic lists</li>

  <li>Created Public Queries for Defects, Modules, Submodules and Module-Submodule Cross Reference.</li>

  <li>Changes some drop downs to be bigger.</li>
</ul>

<p>Jean, to access this new schema repository from the CQ Web login as usual but make sure to select the Schema Repository of MobMM.</p>

<h3>Issues</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Still don't know what to do with CC. I remember that this is for an arbitrary list of email addresses however when and how are they used? IOW when is email sent? When a defect changes state? Which states? IOW if a defect is entered it's in an Assigned state. If it gets resolved then I suspect that's when email is sent. Similarly when verified. What about when deferred? etc. Is the real purpose of CC to allow for separate distinct lists of people to alert via email? I need to read up more on the Email package that Clearquest offers and see if it can do all of this for us in a more standard and already debugger manner.</li>

  <li>Changeset: This should be made a larger field, perhaps on the Management tab because I would think that it will contain file/revision information in a multiline tabular format. I suspect that the editing of this field will be only done from the yet to be written Perforce -&gt; Clearquest connector... IOW will Clearquest users be able to modify that field through Clearquest Client or Clearquest Web?</li>

  <li>Testcase ID &amp; Testplan Version: Any info on what these are or should be? Just text strings? When are they entered in the transition of states...</li>
