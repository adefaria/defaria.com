                              <h2>Microsoft Installations</h2>

<p>Installation of Visual Studio.NET and the Installable File System took forever mostly due to the fact that I was installing is off a share from Roseville.</p>

<h2>MKS Toolkit</h2>

<p>After installing MKS Toolkit I went back to turn off the various services it installs that conflicts with Cygwin. The streamBuild.pl process uses Cygwin so we need that too. I'm not particularly impressed with MKS Toolkit. For example, before MKS installed I tried executing a few of the executables that had been installed already. Each popped up with a dialog box saying it couldn't get a license. Fair enough as the installation had not yet finished. However, this does mean that each time an executable is executed additional work needs to be done to check the license.</p>

<p>In general MKS seems clunkier than Cygwin and less complete. Of course I am biased and unfamilar with MKS. For example, I don't know how MKS handles /etc/passwd and mapping of uids to sids.</p>

<h2>D2R.sh script</h2>

<p>Not many changes needed to be made to D2R.sh, the new, shortened name for osaka_strm_build_D2R.sh, as it was already parameterized fairly well. Some of the INCLUDE environment variable settings changed to accommodate the new locations on the new system.</p>

<h2>Changes to env.pm</h2>

<p>With this new system I decided to go with changing /cygdrive -> /dev - shorter, more convenient, etc. However env.pm was still incorrectly attempting to change drive letter references with /cygdrive and handling it's own path name conversion. Changed this to use cygpath as that's a better way to do this. Plus it takes into account if the user has change the cygdrive prefix.</p>
