  <li>Installed and tested licenses from new server</li>

  <li>Performed chmaster from sons-clearcase -> sons-sc-cc</li>

  <li>Reinstalled Cygwin and got rsh and smake working again</li>

<p><b>Time spent:</b> 3 hours</p>
                           </div>

                              <h2>Licensing</h2>

<p>I've installed the license strings into sons-sc-cc. They seem to work with no problem. Note that people will need to adjust their license server setting as follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Go to Control Panel: Clearcase</li>

  <li>Click on Licensing tab</li>

  <li>Change sons-clearcase -&gt; sons-sc-cc</li>
</ol>

<p><b>Note:</b> Shanghai users will also need to do this!</p>

<h2>Crontab (ctmerge)</h2>

<p>I've copied the ctmerge cronjobs from sons-clearcase -&gt; sons-sc-cc. Somebody will need to create the corresponding views on sons-sc-cc and uncomment out the ctmerge commands in crontab. The problem is that ctmerge requires a view to merge too and nobody created these views on the new machine. The entries look like:</p>

<div class=code><pre>
#00 07 * * * //sons-sc-cc/Views/official/Tools/bin/ctmerge -view /dview/3.2.ccadmin
-branch china_3.2
</pre></div>

<p>As you can see it's commented out. As I said ctmerge requires a view to merge to. So somebody needs to create a 3.2.ccadmin view then do a ct startview to insure it's started, then crontab -e and uncomment the line. Repeat for other ctmerges you need to have running.</p>

<h2>Chmaster</h2>

<p>I performed the chmaster -all to change mastership of all objects over to sons-sc-cc. There were some errors due to the fact that some of the objects were locked. I'm cleaning that up... OK all mastership is now at sons-sc-cc so you should be able to use sons-sc-cc as if it was sons-clearcase. This means that the old config specs should work (i.e. things using branches like rel_3.2 should now work on sons-sc-cc).</p>

<h2>Smake now working again!</h2>

<p>I reinstalled Cygwin and got rsh sons-sc-cc &lt;cmd&gt; working. This means that smake should now work like it used to. I also changed site_parms.US to specify sons-sc-cc as the build server. This means that people using smake should see their builds happening on sons-sc-cc instead of sons-clearcase.</p>

<h2>Last bits of wrap up</h2>

<p>For now I've left sons-clearcase running. This will allow you to continue running as people switch their license serving over to sons-sc-cc. After you believe everybody's successfully using sons-sc-cc and no longer using sons-clearcase I suggest you RDP to sons-clearcase and simply stop Clearcase in the Clearcase control panel. Let that settle for about a week. Anybody who didn't migrate to sons-sc-cc will surely report the problem.</p>

<p>After this period I suggest I get back in there and perform a few rmreplica commands to tell Multisite that the replicated vobs on sons-clearcase no longer exist. This will signal sons-sc-cc and sons-cc to no longer send packets to sons-clearcase to update it's replicas of the vobs.</p>

<p>At that point sons-clearcase is essentially out of the loop and can be decommissioned.</p>
