<p>OK, here's what I found out so far. Using adefaria as a test machine I first checked to see what FlexLM license server was being used on that machine by selecting <b>Start: All Programs: Rational Software: Rational License Key Administrator</b>. It was using just sons-clearcase. Next I attempting to talk to Clearquest by both the Clearquest GUI and cqc.  Then I stopped the FlexLM service on sons-clearcase. I then started the Clearquest GUI and it complained about no license server. Interestingly cqc continued to work. This may be because cqc/cqd opens the Clearquest database in a read only mode.</p>

<p>Next I added sons-sc-cc as a FlexLM License server and retested. Both the Clearcase GUI and cqc were able to obtain a license from sons-sc-cc with no problems. I even shutdown Clearcase on sons-clearcase and I was still able to use Clearcase GUI and cqc from adefaria with no problems.</p>

<p>I then restarted both FlexLM and Clearcase on sons-clearcase.</p>

<p>Dylan, perhaps you want to test this on your workstation. Try adding sons-sc-cc as a FlexLM license server for your desktop. You can toggle off sons-clearcase as a license server and attempt to access Clearquest. You can then stop the FlexLM service on sons-clearcase and test Clearquest access from your machine again. Finally try shutting down Clearcase on sons-clearcase and retest Clearquest access from your machine.</p>

<h3>Adding a FlexLM License Server to your Desktop</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Select <b>Start: All Programs: Rational Software: Rational
License Key Administrator</b>:<br>
    <br>
    <img src="/blogs/Status/images/RLKA_sons-clearcase.jpg" alt=""></li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Select <b>License Keys: License Key Wizard<br>
    <br>
    </b><img src="/blogs/Status/images/LKA_Wizard.jpg" alt=""><br>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Select <b>Next<br>
    </b><br>
    <img src="/blogs/Status/images/Server_Name_and_Port.jpg" alt=""><br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Select <b>Advanced Server Options:<br>
    <br>
    </b><img src="/blogs/Status/images/Client_Server_Configuration.jpg" alt=""><br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Select <b>Add Server:<br>
    </b><br>
    <img src="/blogs/Status/images/Client_Server_Configuration2.jpg" alt=""><br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Click on <b>Values</b> under the <b>Settings</b> on the right
on the <font color="#ff0000">Server Name</font> column type sons-sc-cc
and <b>Enter</b>. The server name should change from "New Server"
-&gt; "sons-sc-cc":<br>
    <br>
    <img src="/blogs/Status/images/Client_Server_Configuration3.jpg" alt=""><br>
    <br>
At this point you can toggle on or off either sons-clearcase or
sons-sc-cc as a license server provider.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Select <b>OK</b> to close this dialog box. You should see
something like:<br>
    <br>
    <img src="/blogs/Status/images/RLKA_both.jpg" alt=""><br>
    <br>
Note that there are 3 lines, two serviced by sons-clearcase (Rational
ClearCase LT and Rational ClearQuest) and one serviced by sons-sc-cc
(Rational ClearQuest). Also note that if you stop FlexLM on
sons-clearcase and refresh or return the Rational Key License
Administrator then licenses served by sons-clearcase will not be listed
(since the server cannot be contacted.<br>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Similarly, all desktops (or Clearquest GUI clients) will have to adjust
their FlexLM License Key Server in a similar manner. Also note that you
can, instead of adding a server, simply click on the sons-clearcase
server then click on <b>Values</b> under the <b>Settings</b> on the
right on the <font color="#ff0000">Server Name</font> column and
replace sons-clearcase with sons-sc-cc.</p>

<p>If the test is successful then I believe that sons-clearcase can be powered off. Again, I think we should still run about a week this way and if things are OK then I can rmreplica the US replicas leaving only the China (sons-cc) ones and the SantaClara (sons-sc-cc) ones.</p>
