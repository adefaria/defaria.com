                              <h3>What's been done</h3>

<ul>
  <li>The EAST test automation tool rantest currently can run <i>properly
formated</i> EAST tests. By <i>properly formated</i> we mean that they
1) run to completion and 2) report a status in their log file.</li>

  <li>Logfile collection for EAST tests is performed and a tar file,
EASTLogs.tgz, is created and if run for record (-rfr) specified that
log file will be checked in (coded but untested - see below).</li>

  <li>Many tests can be run in succession using the -file option and
specifying multiple tests in the file (See <a
 href="http://ranweb/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=ran:rantest">rantest</a> wiki
page).</li>

  <li>A rudimentary conditional test execution facility exists. For
example, testers can name tests then refer to them in a subsequent test
with an "if" statement so as to say "run this test if &lt;named
test&gt; passed (See <a
 href="http://ranweb/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=ran:rantest">rantest</a> wiki
page).</li>

  <li>A facility for running test in the background has been
implemented as some EAST test script must run in the background while
other tests run simultaneously.</li>

  <li>A crude rendezvous system has been implemented such that rantest
will poll the logfile looking for a rendezvous string that will
indicate to rantest that the backgrounded test has reached a certain
point and it's OK to proceed with other tests.</li>

  <li>Logging of what rantest does has been implemented.</li>

  <li>A crude -script test option has been implemented that allows
rantest to "farm out" the verification of a test for tests that
require more complex verification. Any script can be coded. The only
requirement is that it reports success or failure through it's exit
status.</li>

  <li>Worked on learning moshell as some verifications require
moshell.</li>

  <li>Implemented a simple case of verifying that a cell is set up (a
manual verification step for Sim Cell Setup of preSWIT).</li>

  <li>Ngan has created test profiles and Ross Wilson says that we are
going to run these test profiles through rantest this afternoon.</li>

  <li>Documented most of <a
 href="http://ranweb/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=ran:rantest">rantest</a>'s
usage on the wiki.</li>

  <li>Ross and Gantry have created Perl scripts and TPL's such that an
EAST test can drive a TM500. While rantest can run such tests it needs
to be taught how to gather the TM500 log files produced.</li>
</ul>

<h3>What we're impeded on</h3>

<ul>
  <li>I believe many of the SWIT tests are not currently properly
formatted. Such tests will need to be altered before they can be truly
automated through rantest</li>

  <li>WRT preSWIT testing, I need Leslie to modify her tests to
properly write rendezvous strings in SIM Cell Setup so that rendezvous
can work and sanity/preSWIT testing can proceed.</li>

  <li>Gather tests from Ngan (and others) </li>

  <li>We often don't have time on the various RNC's/etc. to perform
testing. Some tests, i.e. SIM Cell Setup, are interruptive of other
EAST engineer's work.</li>

  <li>Moshell is crude, picky and buggy and... not supported by Ericson!</li>
</ul>

<h3>What's next</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Create run for record view and test out -rfr checkin
functionality.</li>

  <li>Get EAST/TM500 test to work (currently failing) so as to
check/modify TM500 logfile creation</li>

  <li>Get EAST/NMS test to work (currently non-existant?) so as to
check/modify NMS logfile creation.</li>

  <li>Implement XML parsing to determine whether or not we have TM500
logs or NMS logs to collect. Either that or get Gantry to change the
format of the message indicating where the logfile is to include what
type of logfile it is.</li>

  <li>Once Leslie modifies tests for rendezvous, attempt sanity again
and add in the -script "IsCellUp &lt;machine&gt; &lt;cell&gt;"
verification.</li>

  <li>Bob wants us to write a simple and a complex example of test
verification. Based on Doug Elder's <i>How to Analyze rnc</i>
document, implement it's verification steps which get progressively
more complex. The IsCellUp script can also serve as an example
verification script.</li>
