                              <h2>Issues with getsysid.pl</h2>

<p>There is a script called getsysid.pl which will get stuff from the Tandem and ftp it locally. The hope was that we could just get stuff back from the Tandem and then use something like diff -r to compare things. There are some issue with that:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Since files are coming off the Tandem their extensions are lost. Therefore while it may be foo.c when in Clearcase, it's just foo when it gets to the Tandem and thus when it comes back from the Tandem it's also just foo. diff -r will not be matching up foo and foo.c</li>

  <li>Typically views on Windows in <i>transparent</i> mode retain their CRLF characteristics. In other words they are in "DOS" mode. Files come back from the Tandem however are in "Unix" mode. This makes every line report as different from diff!</li>

  <li>There's the issue of these "squiggle" lines where version information is encoded in Clearcase and filled in on the Tandem (or visa versa). This lines, of course, will compare differently. Ugh!</li>
</ol>

<p>Perhaps a tool that can take these differences into account...</p>
