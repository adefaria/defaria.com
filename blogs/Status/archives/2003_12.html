                              <p>I decided to check sons-clearcase after Ron implemented his fix for our router problems. Turns out I can't access it again. Not sure if it's the router, the fix or something else. I can VPN into my desktop. I can ping servers such as sonscentral and sonsservices but not sons-clearcase. I tried pinging the gateway and it still dropping packets.

<p>Then when I was attempting to ping sons-clearcase I got the following:

<pre>
$ ping sons-clearcase

Pinging sons-clearcase.SALIRA.COM [192.168.0.99] with 32 bytes of data:

Request timed out.

</pre>

<p>Not sure what this means. Guess I'm gonna have to drive into work again...

<p>Checked sons-clearcase from home and couldn't get to it. Drove in and analyzed the situation. Saw things in the Event Viewer possibly indicating that the network card was bad. Rebooted machine. Couldn't get it up on the network. Ran network trouble shooter and it suggested replacing the network cable. Didn't want to do that. It also suggested to try to plug the network cable into another spot on the hub. Tried that and it worked! Not sure if that was the fix or if sons-clearcase's network card is flaking out. Rebooted once again to come up clean.

                              <p>Went in around 3 PM. Rebooted sons-clearcase. It's back up and running. Noticed that our backups are not really working well (never have been actually). Performed backup by hand.</p>

<p>BackupExec doesn't seem to want to properly do the pre and post commands necessary to backup the vobs. It seems to say that it can execute the cleartool lock command on the remote machine but always fails with an error stating that the pre command failed.</p>

<p>What was really confusing about this is that the Tools vob backup appears to work. Well then I found out that the Tools vob backup was configured to run the pre command but accept non 0 as an OK status whereas the Salira vob was not accepting non 0 as an OK status.</p>

<p>In any event ct lock vob:\<vob> should return 0. In the Tools vob case the lock was not really happening. </p>

<p>Need to speak to Veritas regarding this on Monday and get this finally working correctly.</p>

<p>Meantime at least we have one good backup!</p>

                              <p>I saw some email saying that there was some possible problems with some Clearcase stuff and decided to investigate. I had talked with Ron on Friday and he is aware of our network problems. But today I could not contact sons-clearcase at all. I can seem to ping and otherwise contact other machines such as sonscentral, sonsservices and engineer's desktops such as dko and gtsang. I can even ping sons-cc in Shanghai! I fear there might be something wrong with sons-clearcase itself - perhaps the network card. Why can I contact other machines but not sons-clearcase?</p>

<p>Not sure if I should go in to reboot sons-clearcase and see if she comes up OK. I guess I oughta...</p>

<p>Hmmm... I can't ssh adefaria@adefaria either. Doesn't accept my password. ssh ccadmin@adefaria doesn't work either. Could this be an Active Directory problem too?</p>

<p>Was able to remote desktop to sonscentral. Doesn't seem like my account is locked. Neither is ccadmin. Can't tell if this network issue is just sons-clearcase or a larger problem.</p>

I have built and put a label down but this is sort of an unofficial build.</p>

                              <p>I was interested in how to install Linux and yet keep an old file system. In particular I had my music files on sonslinux and wished to keep them. While installing SuSE I attempted to save the /home file system. Unfortunately when SuSE boots I get:</p>

<pre>
sonslinux:~ # fsck /home
fsck 1.28 (31-Aug-2002)
e2fsck 1.28 (31-Aug-2002)
fsck.ext3: E2fsck not compiled with HTREE support,
        but filesystem /dev/hda6 has HTREE directories.

<p>e2fsck: Get a newer version of e2fsck!<br />
fsck.ext3 /dev/hda6 failed (status 0x8). Run manually!<br />
</pre></p>

<p>Apparenlty Mandrake used some HTREE structures on that file system. While this FS will not fsck it does mount and appears to be accessible.</p>

                              <p>For a long time now it was such that Clearquest would not initially start for me. First I would get a login failed dialog and then I could select OK and login like normal. But Yan asked me to get his Clearquest working as he just got a new system. Here I didn't even get a failed login dialog but instead a dialog about establishing the connection template. I could not get this to work.</p>

<p>I went back to my desk and attempted to select "Set up Clearquest repository" instead of OK'ing past the initial login failed dialog and alas I could not get that to work either. So I called Rational Support.</p>

<p>Eventually the pointed me to <a href="http://www-1.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=203&context=SSBR5D&context=SSBR7N&context=SSMMQY&context=SSSGSH&context=SSSGV8&context=SSSGW8&context=SSSGX3&context=SSSGXW&context=SSMMS4&context=SSSGYQ&context=SSSH27&context=SSNJU5&context=SSBQNN&context=SSBQS8&context=SSUL78&context=SSBR9L&context=SSSH32&context=SSSH3S&context=SSSH4K&context=SSBRB9&context=SSSH5A&context=SSNJQS&context=SSUTY2&context=SSJMXE&context=SSBQTS&context=SSMMM5&context=SSBQW4&context=SSBQXM&context=SSSH6V&context=SSSH89&context=SSSH8W&context=SSSH9N&context=SSSHAD&context=SSSHAZ&context=SSSHBU&context=SSSHCT&context=SSSHDX&context=SSSHHF&context=SSJPA5&context=SSSHEM&context=SSSHFC&context=SSSHG2&context=SSSHGQ&context=SSSHJ8&context=SSSHJY&context=SSSHKL&context=SSJPCD&context=SSSHL7&context=SSMML4&context=SSMMHM&context=SSBRGQ&context=SSSHLQ&context=SSSHQR&context=SSSHMK&context=SSSHN6&context=SSSHNT&context=SSSHPH&context=SSMMF4&context=SSSHRJ&context=SSSHSK&context=SSSHT4&context=SSSHTR&context=SSBQZT&context=SSSHUF&context=SSSHVH&context=SSSHVY&context=SSSHWL&context=SSSHXB&context=SSBR3M&context=SSSHXU&context=SSSHYJ&context=SSSJ2Z&context=SSSJ2D&context=SSSHZT&context=SSSHZ9&context=SSBRDT&q1=18808&uid=swg21124805&loc=en_US&cs=utf-8&lang=en+en">here</a> which solved both my problem and Yan's.

                              <ol>
<li>Installed Solaris 7.0</li>
<li>Installed SAM for Sun</li>
<li>Downloaded Netscape and other patches for Sun</li>
</ol>
                              
                              Installation of Solaris 7.0 did result in man pages and other things being installed. Still the Sun seems like it's missing lots of stuff like make, gcc, bash, etc. 

<p>Created some users and attempted to get remote XDMCP sessions going. Not working.

<p>SAM installed but isn't working properly yet.

<p>Can't install Netscape until we install patches. Having difficulty installing patches.
