                              <p>Ah the comfort of being able to get through the firewall! It feels so good. Now I can read email from my home and use IM again! Yippie!</p>

<p>Alas my system will be moving in two days as I am moving too! Things will be hectic for the short term.</p>

<p>At work I worked on the script to add triggers to the vobs a bit more. Still need to convert it to Perl...</p>

<p>Started investigating adding storage to the servers. This may get a little tricky. Need to meet with Brian and Babu about this.</p>

<p>Played with the web server some more - now pointing it into the actual vob. Had a hell of time doing this as things were acting weird. Rebooted my system and wham! Everythings good now...</p>

                              <p>This afternoon, after returning from the training I did:

<ul>

<li><p>Worked on problem with case perserving MVFS. Two of the servers had case perserving set off so I fixed that. While working on another problem one of those servers rebooted. Oh well, at least that fixes it's case preserving. The other server was later rebooted. Still clients need to make sure that they have case preserving set on and need to reboot. Unfortunately this was not set properly during the rollout.</p></li>

<li><p>Worked on a problem view with no success. Unable to get it to work. Keep getting <i>unknown error in view server</i> - not very helpful.</p></li>

<li><p>Got my user ID finally! Was able to run Lotus Notes. Oh boy, what joy! Anyways I was able to send email via Ameriquest's email server. Still can't pop nor imap it though.</p></li>

<li><p>Installed Cygwin on some of the servers as well as set up my environment. Need to get my new user ID added into the Clearcase group. Can now ssh into some of the servers to perform actions.</p></li>

<li><p>Set up Apache under Cygwin on one server. Babu asked me to see if I could make a read only web server to view thing.</p></li>

</ul>

                              <p>Well I got an apartment! It's called <i>The Lake</i> and it sure has a large lake. The apartment is a 1 bedroom with a loft and it's 1000 square feet. I have the lake right off my patio. This means that I need to move in this coming weekend! Gotta get busy.</p>

<p>My car's transmission decided to die so I could not drive down and had to fly in instead. Well the flight was nice but it was too damn short! :-) Looks like I'll need a new car. Wonder if I can get the Eclipse back...</p>

<p>Today at work I get in and started downloading the tarball of <i>my stuff</i>. Wonder when I'll get my own userid? Then Babu tells me to come with him. Off to another Clearcase Training class that he's holding in another Ameriquest building (Apparently there are a lot of Ameriquest buildings and we might be moving to one of them. This other building was brand new and quite nice). The class was OK but they were not ready for us so we had to make due with a small conference room and just use Babu's laptop for class exercises. Then Babu cuts out and leaves me to finish up the training! It's only my 3rd day here and I'm supposed to train!?! Oh well. It wasn't that bad but I was not prepared for that.</p>

<p>Got a ton of things to do and to keep track of</p>

                              <p>Well made it here. We're on the 9th floor of this building. Argh, having to go through all of the <i>new things</i> like badges, user ids, etc. Apparently this shop is much more closed up than the old place. I cannot, for example, get through to my machine at home for email and the like. I can get to my home page. Guess I'm gonna have to implement that web mail thing after all!</p>

<p>Can't ftp home, can't use IM. No IMAP. No POP. Apparently they also restrict other web sites like sports related stuff, etc.</p>

<p>Interesting in that they apparently use Lotus Notes for email. Argh! This is gonna be a fight regarding tools and the like. </p>

<p>Created a vob, view, etc today. We are supposed to be doing a lot of client installs today and tomorrow.</p>

<p>Managed to install Cygwin partially and get some semblence of my environment.</p>
