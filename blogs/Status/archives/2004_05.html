Anyways, I was not able to update it recently. It complained about CM_TOOLS not being a Clearcase object! I banged on it for a while and couldn't figured it out. Sensing an opportunity to shorten a pathname, I discussed this with Don and we decided to create a new snapshot view, on the real view server (rtnlprod02) with a shorter name. So I created the PMO snapshot view. This makes the path \\rtnlprod02\viewstore\PMO\CM_TOOLS\...</p>

<p>Note, I have already taken care of adjusting the triggers, mktriggers.pl, ccase_[un]lock_vobs.bat jobs and the task_registry.</p>

<h3>ASAP_NOTIFY Trigger</h3>

<p>Triggers are kept in the CM_TOOLS vob. Also there is a mktriggers.pl script whose responsibility is to add/replace all triggers to all vobs. It works off a data file and is a fairly flexible facility. Some triggers are applied to all vobs (e.g. PROTECT), some to base Clearcase vobs only (e.g. CHECK_COMMENT) and some to specific vobs (e.g. ASAP_NOTIFY). This script is designed to be run at any time and will reinstate the correct status of triggers in the vobs. It is very handy to have a script to set up your triggers. One place where this will be very useful is when we get to Multisiting things. Multisite will replicate the vobs but not their triggers. Multisite can be used to make a "backup region" which can be useful in disaster recovery. Being able to quickly reinstate your triggers in these cases if very valuable.</p>

<p>As for another trigger to log activity I see it going this way...</p>

<p>A vob activity trigger is a useful idea and it's conceivable that other projects might want such a facility. Being that the "log" is really an html file there are only 2 things that are needed: 1) a web server and it's URL and 2) writable space to put these html files. Additionally one might be concerned with managing this space (trimming/removing log files over time) and perhaps presenting an interface into this history.</p>

<p>I think a trigger should be developed or culled out of the current trigger, which performs two distinct tasks, generalized and made available for the ASAP_Docs vob and other vobs as the vob owners require. This trigger can be implemented as an "all element" trigger (covering the whole vob) or just a trigger that can be attached as we have done for 03_Design. Being generalized more information must be written into the log (html) file to distinguish the elements more precisely. These are the vob name (e.g. ASAP_Src) and the path into the vob (e.g. ASAP\Include) (If we keep on logfile per vob then the vob name can stay promoted in the heading).</p>

<p>So the table entry would change from:</p>

<h2>Elements modified in \ASAP_Docs on 05-17-2004</h2>

    <table border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=2>
      <tr bgcolor="#c0c0c0" align="center" nowrap>
        <th>User Name</th>
        <th>Element Type</th>
        <th>Element Name</th>
        <th>Element version</td>
        <th>Comment</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>ss046959</td>
        <td>ms_word</td>
        <td>ASAP_modelnotes_1.doc</td>
        <td>\main\dev\2</td>
        <td>checkout and check in test only. no modification of data</td>
      </tr>
<tr>
  <td>ss046959</td>
  <td>directory</td>
  <td>ASAP_Prototype_Documents</td>
  <td>\main\dev\2</td>
  <td>this is just a checkin check out test.testing the ccweb and the new trigge
r on this folder.no data was modified. </td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>To:</p>

    <table border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=2>
      <tr bgcolor="#c0c0c0" align="center" nowrap>
        <th>User</th>
        <th>Type</th>
        <th>Path</th>
        <th>Name</th>
        <th>Version</td>
        <th>Comment</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>ss046959</td>
        <td>ms_word</td>
        <td>\03_Design\Conceptual Data Model\2004_04_15</td>
        <td>ASAP_modelnotes_1.doc</td>
        <td>\main\dev\2</td>
        <td>checkout and check in test only. no modification of data</td>
      </tr>
<tr>
  <td>ss046959</td>
  <td>directory</td>
  <td>\03_Design\Prototypes</td>
  <td>ASAP_Prototype_Documents</td>
  <td>\main\dev\2</td>
  <td>this is just a checkin check out test.testing the ccweb and the new trigge

</tr>
</table>

<p>This would not be that hard. The trigger would take one parameter, the path to the share to write the html files to (e.g. \\webapp01\Rational\asapcm\logs in the instant case).</p>

<p>If this trigger was created and implemented (and removed from the current trigger) then all that's left in the current trigger is the sending of email. This could be accomplished with the existing NotifyTrigger.pl and a data file such as:</p>

<pre>
From: Vobadm <vobadm@Ameriquest.net>
To: <***ADD EMAIL ADDRESSES HERE***>
Subject: $CLEARCASE_OP_KIND notification: $CLEARCASE_PN
--
This is a notification that a $CLEARCASE_OP_KIND has occurred:

Element:        $CLEARCASE_PN
Branch:         $CLEARCASE_BRTYPE
Operation:      $CLEARCASE_OP_KIND
User:           $CLEARCASE_USER
View:           $CLEARCASE_VIEW_TAG
Comments:

$CLEARCASE_COMMENT
</pre>

</p>To view historical information see http://ASAPCM.Ameriquest.net/logs</p>

<p>The trigger replaces $ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE. We would just need to modify this data file to be From: ASAPAdmin@Ameriquest.net (and we really should hook up a real person to that email address), add the email addresses to the To line.</p>

<p>The URL http://ASAPCM.Ameriquest.net/logs is a directory so the web server will look for certain files such as index.html and index.cgi. An index.cgi script could be written that writes out a web page showing today's activity, complete with a little calendar with links to prior history.</p>

<blockquote><p>Actually, I'd recommend perhaps collapsing the modified/newelements by adding a column that simply says something like "Modified" or "Added". This way we don't have to deal separately with modified vs. newly added in index.cgi nor in any of the historical html logfile.</p></blockquote>

<p>This way the email message is simplified. The recipients get notification via email that something has changed with enough information to tell them the specific change. If they want to know about other things that changed recently they are pointed to one place to see the current data, with an easy way to scroll back through time.</p>

<p>Now I've done such little web apps on my domain (http://defaria.com) in Perl and PHP. Given a preference I'd prefer PHP. However http;//asapcm.ameriquest.net is running IIS and I have no idea of how to set up and run Perl/PHP on IIS.</p>

<li>Reworked the ASAP_NOTIFY trigger:</br>

<br>I have changed the trigger that you sent us to operate correctly in the Clearcase environment. This involved quite a few steps:

<ul>
<li>Changed to use the proper Perl conventions of -w and use strict.</li>
<li>Changed to work under ccperl, thus guaranteeing that it will work for all Clearcase clients</li>
<li>Changed to use Net::SMTP, which is already in ccperl, instead of requiring sendmail.pm</li>
<li>General code clean up. Also made a few subroutine to help logic flow.</li>
<li>Changed to write html logfiles to their web server</li>
<li>Changed to send link to html log file in the email.</li>
<li>Added this ASAP_NOTIFY trigger to the mktriggers mechanism.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>Started investigating Ant</li>

<li>Fixed rgy_backup on rtnlprod01. Don't know how it was broke nor how exactly I fixed it.

                              In trying to test this out before actually implementing this on the production vob I found that this does not appear to work as expected. Here's what I did:

<ol>

<li>Created a new share on the production server (rtnlprod01) named defaria</li>
<li>Set share permissions to Everyone: Full Control (for now).</li>
<li>Created a private vob defaria2 with a path of \\rtnlprod01\defaria\defaria2.vbs. This vob is owned by vobadm and the group is CC-PMO.</li>
<li>Mounted the vob on my desktop and through my already existing defaria view I copied some files into the vob root directory as well as made a subfolder with some files in there too.</li>
<li>Added all files and folders to source control. This is now my test vob.</li>
<li>Unmounted the \defaria2 vob from my desktop. (Note I also had to find and kill the vob_server, db_server and vobrpc_server processes on the vob server that were associated with this vob, \defaria2, as unmounting a vob does not stop these processes)</li>
<li>Changed the share permission on the \\rtnlprod01\defaria share by removing Everyone and adding two groups: CC-PMO, which I am a part of, which will serve as the read/write test group and CC-TTE, which I am not a part of, which will serve as the read only test group. These two groups were added with Full Control to the share. Since CC-TTE is not a member of the vob group list they will fall into using the "other" permissions setting for the vob, which will limit them to read only. CC-PMO, being part of the vob group list will use the "group" permissions setting which will provide read/write.</li>
<li>Next I remounted the vob on my desktop and checked out a file. So far so good. (I'm acting as a member of CC-PMO - a read/writer at this time)</li>
<li>When I went to check in this file, however, I received the following error: "mvfs: ERROR: view=defaria vob=\defaria2 - ClearCase vob error see view_log on host rtnlprod02 for more info"</li>
<li>Checking rtnlprod02 (the view server)'s view log shows me: 'view_server.exe(5684): Error: Unable to construct cleartext for object "0x46" in VOB "rtnlprod01:D:\defaria\defaria2.vbs": error detected by ClearCase subsystem' and 'text_file_delta: Error: Unable to open file  \\rtnlprod01\defaria\defaria2.vbs\s\sdft\1f\a\0-8d2a90ad41134b1e9cddf04d42034d38-tk": Permission denied'</li>
<li>Unmounted the vob again and went to the server and killed the vob_server/db_server/vobrpc_process again</li>
<li>Added Everyone: Full Control back to the share point (leaving both CC-PMO and CC-TTE)</li>
<li>Remounted the vob on my desktop. The first thing that I noticed was that the element did not have a checked out symbol next to it and it was accessible. Checked out and checked in the element again. No problems.</li>

</ol>

<p>So it seems that there is some process in the Clearcase Explorer that requires that the share point have Everyone: Full Control set (or at least something more than just CC-PMO and CC-TTE). Note that if I click somewhere out of the directory, like to the subfolder then go back I get the "mvfs: ERROR..." again. I see no errors in the cleartool command line - just in Clearcase Explorer.</p>

<p>Seems the answer to the problem is to add clearcase_albd to the share permissions. I also added vobadm and the CCADMIN group</p>

<li>Worked on ASAP_BUS_REQ request to set up a read only group</li>

<li>Worked on Steve Nameroff's request to set up FlexLM monitoring</li>

</ul>
                              
                              <h3>ASAP_BUS_REQ</h3>

<p>I spoke with Rational (PMR # 32008999) regarding how to set it up so that one group (CC-ASAP-BUS) has read/write and another group (CC-ASAP-BUS-RO) has read only access to the ASAP_BUS_REQ vob while all others have no access. The problem is this: While there may be multiple groups associated with a vob there is only one group Read/Write/eXecute mask that is shared by all groups on the vob group list. So if CC-ASAP-BUS and CC-ASAP-BUS-RO are on the vob group list and the mask is Read/Write and execute then both the members of CC-ASAP-BUS and CC-ASAP-BUS-RO will have Read/Write and Execute access.</p>

<p>There is a work around but it involves moving the ASAP_BUS_REQ vob to it's own share, setting ASAP_BUS_REQ to 774, thereby enabling Read access for "Other" then controlling access to this vob through the share permissions. This, unfortunately cannot be done today and you would need to enter a Paragrine ticket as well as schedule this. </p>

<h3>FlexLM monitoring</h3>

Steve wanted me to turn on FlexLM monitoring. According to Mike Hrenko:

<blockquote>
<p>You will need an options file on the license server to create the report log. In the options file you will add a REPORTLOG line to create a report log.</p>

<p>For example: REPORTLOG +c:\flexlm\reportlog.rl</p>

<p>The plus sign appends new information to the existing report log when you restart the license server. You must restart server to initiate reportlog.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, according to <a href="http://www.globetrotter.com/chap5.htm#wp894762">5.2.15 REPORTLOG</a> one only need to add the REPORTLOG [+]report_log_path to the proper options file. Further, according to <a href="http://www.globetrotter.com/chap5.htm#wp894762">5.1 Creating an Options File</a> one can create an option file anywhere. So I did. Called it Rational.opt. Restarted FlexLM but nothing. It says to add the path to the options file to the license file but I have not managed to locate a license file. Even searched the entire D drive for things like "VENDER Rational" to no avail.</p>

                              <p>Spend most of my time setting up a test environment for the web pages. Problem is that the web server (Apache) cannot see the M drive when started as a service so it must refer to a snapshot view. Created webview for this purpose. But how does on test when in order to do so would require to publish your changes?</p>

<p>So I created another view, webtest. But how does Apache reference two different DocumentRoot's? We don't have the power of aliasing, and there's the two web servers to consider: c09-272-a and rtnlprod02.</p>

<p>Ended up configuring Apache to listen on two different ports at the same time using VirtualHosts on both servers.</p>

<p>Then I hit a problem with snapshot views not honoring symlinks properly - it copies the elements instead - and difficulty in updating such things. You see I was attempting to share css and images folders by means of a symlink. Abandoned that idea. Still need to hammer out where I have full URL's and pay attention to the different ports, etc...</p>

<p>Emailed Rory Valle regarding backups, he says they are being done. Also prodded James Portugal again about LDAP access. Finally attended the CM Staff meeting</p>

<li>Worked hard with the TTE group to try to resolve the problem with comparing versions. Reproduced problem in a snapshot view. Seems there is still some permissions problem lurking. Can compare in dynamic view. Can compare in an ASCII fashion. Cannot compare in a GUI fashion with any other version than version 0 (or other empty data container. Tried fix_prot. Tried vob_sidwalk. Nothing is working. Contacted Rational. Working with Rational on this problem.</li>

<li>Moved web pages into CM_DOCS vob. Reconfigured web servers to point there. Changed LicenseMonitoring to work in this new context. Created webview snapshot view to access this with. Would like to use a dynamic view but Apache can't seem to see the M drive (Probably because it's running as a service).</li>

<li>Helped Bruce Durbin create a dynamic view</li>

<li>Worked with Loren Gifford on a problem he was having comparing elements</li>

<li>Eventually needed to create new vob and import Core_automation to it</li>

<li>Went to get cell phone.</li>

<li>Wrote findview to search for views in all regions</li>

</ul>
                              
                              <p>Bruce et. al. seem to be against using dynamic views. Apparently they want all there views to be centered at C:\QA. Also, test machine doesn't have Clearcase so they use snapshot views for that. Suggested they install Clearcase on the test machine and make their test automation work from a base.</p>

<p>Re-created a snapshot view for him but was still unable to perform compares. Things are odd in that if I <b>Compare to another version</b> then I can compare the checked out version with it's predessor but if I did <b>Compare to previous</b> it fails with an error message of "Error while doing compare". Ended up asking Timmie to reinstall Clearcase. Not sure if this fixed his problem</p>

<p>Users still reported problems with things like comparing versions. Mike determined through checkvob that there were still permissions problems on storage containers so we decided to create a new vob and clearexport_ccase/clearimport things. Unfortunately vobadm is not included in the CC-TTE group (nor the CC-EDA group) so I temporarily switched group ownership of this vob to CC-PMO, which vobadm is a member of, to do the import, then cleartool protectvob -chgrp back to CC-TTE</p>
