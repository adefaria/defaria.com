                        <div class="entry-content">

                              <ul>
  <li>Implemented a load balancing redirection scheme for cqweb</li>
</ul>
                              
                              <h2>Load Balancing CQ Web Servers based on Number of CQ Web Users</h2>

<p>The task at hand was to write a redirector that load balances amongst a number of CQ Web servers based on the number of CQ Web Users currently on each server. Additionally, based on how the user came into the CQ Web server farm, redirect them to the proper schema.</p>

<h3>Determining Load</h3>

<p>The old IIS CQ Web Server used to allow you to query the number of active CQ Web Users. The new Apache/Tomcat server only allows admins to do this. Additionally the admin need to be logged in, thus have a valid token. IBM/Rational suggests using Apache's server-status URL to determine load. However that only displays number of Apache requests in progress not number of CQ Web Users.</p>

<p>If ExtendedStatus is turned on then Apache lists each connection and the URL they are working on. By filtering "GET /cqweb" we can get a rough estimate of the number of CQ Web Users. There is a problem in that the redirector script cannot query the same web server that it's running on. Additionally this information can only be obtained if ExtendedStatus is turned on.</p>

<h2>Algorithm for selecting a server</h2>

<p>The algorithm for selecting a non busy server is described as:</p>

<p>Pick a lightly loaded server out of the pool. Note that if a server is not running with ExtendedStatus on then $cq_users will be undef. This is different than the case where the server has ExtendedStatus on but there just aren't any CQ Web users (which would be denoted by $cq_users = 0). Thus we may have the condition where:

<table cellspacing=0 cellpadding=2 border=1>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>Server</th>
      <th>cq_users</th>
      <th>ExtendedStatus</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>server1</td>
      <td>undef</td>
      <td>off</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>server2</td>
      <td>20</td>
      <td>on</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>server3</td>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>on</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>server4</td>
      <td>10</td>
      <td>on</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
<table>

<p>In such a case we wish to pick server3 since it has no current CQ web users.

<p>The algorithm used here will be to remove all servers from the pool who are not running with ExtendedStatus on since we cannot reliably tell how loaded the server is from the standpoint of CQ Web users. If, however, no servers have ExtendedStatus on (thus all $cq_users return as undef) then we will consider the $nbr_apache_requests. IOW $nbr_apache_requests is not equivalent with $cq_users and thus they cannot be compared together. But if no server is running with ExtendedStatus on we need to pick something!</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> If $random then a server is simply randomly chosen.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, given this algorithm, if we had the following situation:</p>
 
<table cellspacing=0 cellpadding=2 border=1>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>Server</th>
      <th>cq_users</th>
      <th>ExtendedStatus</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>server1</td>
      <td>undef</td>
      <td>on</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>server2</td>
      <td>undef</td>
      <td>off</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>server3</td>
      <td>undef</td>
      <td>off</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>server4</td>
      <td>10</td>
      <td>on</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
<table>

<p>Then this algorithm will always return server4.</p>

<p><b><font color=red>Important Note:</font></b> The web server doing the redirection cannot be queried. Attempting to do so hangs! Therefore it cannot participate in the server pool. It is recommended that another web server be set up as the redirector and the DNS name cqweb assigned to it. This web server can, however, participate by being a Clearquest Request Manager.</p>

<h3>Random Redirection</h3>

<p>The script can also redirect randomly instead of relying on load of CQ Web Users. Currently there are 3 servers in the pool. Only one of them has ExtendedStatus turned on. As such redirecting by load will always resolve to the one server using, the one running with ExtendedStatus on. This is not good. So currently it just picks a server randomly from the pool. This behavior is controlled by the <tt>lb</tt> parameter (currently defaulted to off meaning pick server randomly).

<h3>Defining the Server Pool</h3>

<p>The server pool is defined by a small file, servers.cfg, which simply list the servers participating in the pool. Servers can be added or removed dynamically.</p>

<h3>Mapping Redirection</h3>

<p>In the past users went to http://cqweb/&lt;area&gt;. These <areas> were HTML files in the DocumentRoot which redirected to a series of redirection scripts. It was hoped that HTTP_REFERER could be used to determine where to redirect the visitor. Unfortunately HTTP_REFERER is not guaranteed and indeed it's undefined on the web servers!</p>

<p>Instead one must specify the <tt>group</tt> parameter to the redirector script. The script then maintains a map between &lt;areas&gt; -> Schema/ContextIDs. If the group is not specified or not in the map then the user is redirected to the main login page. This is not viewed as a hardship because we need redirecting &lt;area&gt; files anyway. The new form of redirecting &lt;area&gt; file is:

<div class=code><pre>
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&ltmdeta http-equiv="refresh" content="0; url=http://cqweb.itg.ti.com/cgi-bin/redirect.pl?group=&lt<i>area</i>&gt;&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
</pre></div>

<h3>Redirect Map</h3>

<p>The redirect map, stored in redirect.map, is a file of key/value pairs. For example:</p>

<div class=code><pre>
CMDT:           &schema=CMDT.2003.06.00&contextid=CMDT
CSSD:           &schema=omap.2002.05.00&contextid=OMAPS

SDO_TEST:       &schema=SDS_TST_DEV&contextid=SDSCM
WiMax:          &schema=WiMax.SR5&contextid=WiMax
mDTV:           &schema=mDTV.2003.06.00&contextid=MDTV
mDTV_play:      &schema=mDTV.2003.06.00&contextid=PLAY
</pre></div>

<h3>Parameters for redirect.pl</h3>

<p>The following parameters, specified in the URL, are supported by redirect.pl:</p>

<dl>
  <dt>group</dt>
    <dd>Specifies the key into the redirect.map for the schema/contextid. If not specified then defaults to main login page of the selected server</dd>

  <dt>lb</dt>
    <dd>If set then load balancing is attempted based on ExtendedStatus and CQ Web Users as described above. Default: undefined (off)</dd>

  <dt>debug</dt>
    <dd>If specified the user is not redirected rather debugging information is output.</dd>

                              <p>As you know there have been service interruptions in CQWeb. I keep looking at the logs for clues. About the only consistent thing is an error similar to this:</p>

</pre></div>

<p>Now "Connection reset by peer" could be an error that the process gets because the service has stopped so this could be more of a symptom than a cure. However searching for "Ajp13Processor socket write error" points me to <a href="http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/tomcat-users/200203.mbox/%3C751828609.20020327090907@e-box.dk%3E">this
post</a> which suggests increasing the stack and heap sizes for the JVM. Problems that are intermittent can be consistent with running out of stack or heap size.<./p>

  <p>All these machines have 2 gig of main memory and largely just serve CQWeb. Indeed the CQWeb service processes are consuming most of the memory:</p>

<p>I think we should try setting at least the following:</p>

<div class=code><pre>
wrapper.jvm.options=-Xrs -Xms128m -Xmx512m
</pre></div>

<p>A restart of all CQ Web services would probably be needed for the changes to become effective. The above settings start off the jvm @ 128m for all 4 processes thus a total memory footprint of 512 Meg and limit each process to 512 Meg max for a total footprint of 2 Gig (when full). We might want to bounce this idea off IBM/Rational support to see if all 4 process should have the same settings or if we show vary
them.</p>

[Wed Sep 27 10:52:39 2006] [error] [client 128.247.39.85] [Wed Sep 27 10:52:39 2006] 
create.pl: Useless use of concatenation (.) or string in void context at OMAPS.pm line 318, &lt;CNF&gt; line 139.
</pre></div>

<p>Line 318 of OMAPS.pm is:</p>
<div class=code><pre>
debug ("add user $data-&gt;{login_name} to team "<u><font color="#ff0000"><b>)</b></font></u> . $cgi-&gt;param("Team");
</pre></div>
But it should read:<br>
<div class=code><pre>
debug ("add user $data-&gt;{login_name} to team " . $cgi-&gt;param("Team")<u><font color="#009900"><b>)</b></font></u>;
</pre></div>

<p>As we are watching the log files carefully for signs of Clearquest web hangs and outages it would be helpful if this superfluous error were eliminated.</p>

<p>I fixed this by hand on dfls[83-85] but it should be fixed in the original.</p>

<p>We get a lot of errors in the logs of the form:</p>

</pre></div>

These errors are not a big deal except they cloud the log files with meaningless stuff that you need to skip over all the time. I decided to look into this and see where they were coming from. In the file .../rwp/webapps/wre/common/script/common.js there appeared the following code:

<div class=code><pre>
var arrowOff=new Image();
     arrowOff.src="images/shim.gif";
var arrowOn=new Image();
      arrowOn.src="images/arrow_red.gif" ;
</pre></div>

<p>This appears to be causing the problem so I updated that JavaScript to:</p>

<div class=code><pre>
var arrowOff=new Image();
    arrowOff.src="/wre/common/images/shim.gif";
var arrowOn=new Image();
        arrowOn.src="/wre/common/images/arrow_red.gif" ;
</pre></div>

<p>I'm not sure if this is a Rational problem or something that TI has done but with the above fix the error seems to go away. Well at least for me. I suspect others are still generating the error because JavaScript is cached by the browser. Hopefully as people restart there browsers this will go away.</p>

<p>Additionally the following error is still appearing in the logs:</p>

<div class=code><pre>
[Mon Sep 25 20:31:06 2006] [error] [client 172.24.80.20] File does not exist:
C:/Program Files/Rational/Common/rwp/htdocs/favicon.ico
</pre></div>

<p>I've put a favicon.ico in the proper area on dfls85. The error seems to have diminished however I don't see a favicon in the browser so I'm not sure if this is working.</p>

<p>The two "fixes" above will need to be replicated to the other servers (dfls83 and 84) at some time.</p>

<p>Finally another error shows up:</p>

<div class=code><pre>

</pre></div>

<p>This seems to be an error in CSSD's code which is located under .../Rational/cgi-bin. Going to <a href="http://dfls85/cgi-bin/create.pl">http://dfls85/cgi-bin/create.pl</a> first redirects me to TI's authentication web page but then back to, in my case, <a href="http://dfls85/cgi-bin/create.pl?stoken=nJAROWWcvXf2s4lwHoGETsko1vphx%2fLqHxNu7IU4L6axrg6DrEJiVoIi8ACLnoycJTlPsGJlCDLr3MhbcRx4DXgvut4ea6d%2bU%2bWzQR3oBpa6NsxSH7EPctkp96%2b9UkgIHfwh%2fWYSI0pO1wu6uHVcGgpT5tAuSpF0a3vBMgRZN8hoU0TPYJEQ9z6nNI99fKhjRh6SRNDmDdM%3d">here</a>.

                              <h2>Integrating LDAP to enable_ldap</h2>

<p>I decided it would be good if as enable_ldap gathers parameters, it checks to see if they are correct. It does this by actually calling LDAP calls to validate the things like the server, port, etc. The goal is to make enable_ldap insure that the parameters are indeed correct. Unfortunately this makes enable_ldap dependent on the Net::LDAP module but I think it's worth it to allow enable_ldap to check the parameters and the mapping the user is describing.</p>

<p>I still need to tighten up the code where it queries LDAP and attempts to prove to the user that the mapping is correct. As I understand it you are basically attempting to map a Clearquest field to an LDAP field so that Clearquest can find the correct record. Once that linkage is established Clearquest can "pull" the password from LDAP and thus authenticate the user's password to the LDAP password.</p>

<p>What enable_ldap does is effectively this, however, it's not that informative to simply say "The user ID 'foo' was found in the LDAP directory" rather I want to say "The user id 'foo' corresponds with '&lt;fullname&gt;'". However does "fullname" always appear exactly as that in LDAP?</p>

<p>Additionally, I need to handle the cases where it's not a match or where say multiple entries are returned (not sure how that can happen unless the user specifies an attribute that can have dups or perhaps enters in a wildcard, e.g. "defaria*").</p>

<p>OK, here's what I found out so far. Using adefaria as a test machine I first checked to see what FlexLM license server was being used on that machine by selecting <b>Start: All Programs: Rational Software: Rational License Key Administrator</b>. It was using just sons-clearcase. Next I attempting to talk to Clearquest by both the Clearquest GUI and cqc.  Then I stopped the FlexLM service on sons-clearcase. I then started the Clearquest GUI and it complained about no license server. Interestingly cqc continued to work. This may be because cqc/cqd opens the Clearquest database in a read only mode.</p>

<p>Next I added sons-sc-cc as a FlexLM License server and retested. Both the Clearcase GUI and cqc were able to obtain a license from sons-sc-cc with no problems. I even shutdown Clearcase on sons-clearcase and I was still able to use Clearcase GUI and cqc from adefaria with no problems.</p>

<p>I then restarted both FlexLM and Clearcase on sons-clearcase.</p>

<p>Dylan, perhaps you want to test this on your workstation. Try adding sons-sc-cc as a FlexLM license server for your desktop. You can toggle off sons-clearcase as a license server and attempt to access Clearquest. You can then stop the FlexLM service on sons-clearcase and test Clearquest access from your machine again. Finally try shutting down Clearcase on sons-clearcase and retest Clearquest access from your machine.</p>

<h3>Adding a FlexLM License Server to your Desktop</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Select <b>Start: All Programs: Rational Software: Rational
License Key Administrator</b>:<br>
    <br>
    <img src="/blogs/Status/images/RLKA_sons-clearcase.jpg" alt=""></li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Select <b>License Keys: License Key Wizard<br>
    <br>
    </b><img src="/blogs/Status/images/LKA_Wizard.jpg" alt=""><br>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Select <b>Next<br>
    </b><br>
    <img src="/blogs/Status/images/Server_Name_and_Port.jpg" alt=""><br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Select <b>Advanced Server Options:<br>
    <br>
    </b><img src="/blogs/Status/images/Client_Server_Configuration.jpg" alt=""><br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Select <b>Add Server:<br>
    </b><br>
    <img src="/blogs/Status/images/Client_Server_Configuration2.jpg" alt=""><br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Click on <b>Values</b> under the <b>Settings</b> on the right
on the <font color="#ff0000">Server Name</font> column type sons-sc-cc
and <b>Enter</b>. The server name should change from "New Server"
-&gt; "sons-sc-cc":<br>
    <br>
    <img src="/blogs/Status/images/Client_Server_Configuration3.jpg" alt=""><br>
    <br>
At this point you can toggle on or off either sons-clearcase or
sons-sc-cc as a license server provider.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Select <b>OK</b> to close this dialog box. You should see
something like:<br>
    <br>
    <img src="/blogs/Status/images/RLKA_both.jpg" alt=""><br>
    <br>
Note that there are 3 lines, two serviced by sons-clearcase (Rational
ClearCase LT and Rational ClearQuest) and one serviced by sons-sc-cc
(Rational ClearQuest). Also note that if you stop FlexLM on
sons-clearcase and refresh or return the Rational Key License
Administrator then licenses served by sons-clearcase will not be listed
(since the server cannot be contacted.<br>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Similarly, all desktops (or Clearquest GUI clients) will have to adjust
their FlexLM License Key Server in a similar manner. Also note that you
can, instead of adding a server, simply click on the sons-clearcase
server then click on <b>Values</b> under the <b>Settings</b> on the
right on the <font color="#ff0000">Server Name</font> column and
replace sons-clearcase with sons-sc-cc.</p>

<p>If the test is successful then I believe that sons-clearcase can be powered off. Again, I think we should still run about a week this way and if things are OK then I can rmreplica the US replicas leaving only the China (sons-cc) ones and the SantaClara (sons-sc-cc) ones.</p>

<p>I had hoped to be able to user the /g parm to setup.exe so that the install would be silent and automatic. Clearquest now installs without need for a reboot. But silent install installs silently but then reboots! Ugh!</p>

<p>Also wanted to be able to specify multiple license servers as TI uses 3 of them. I hoped that merely updating sitedefs.dat to list three of them, comma separated would work. But it doesn't. Perhaps spaces? Also need to check siteprep to see if the area can be reprepped with 3 license servers</p>

                              <p>I looked on sons-sc-cc first for multisite errors. In /apps/Rational/Clearcase/var/logs there are logs regarding multisite. Some of the log files pointed me to look in the Event Viewer. In the Event Viewer I saw things like:</p>

</pre></div>

<p>I remember problems with sons-cc occasionally having its albd_server go whacky and taking up 50% of the CPU. Doesn't seem to be the case this time. Then again, the RDP session you have on adefaria -> sons-cc died. Perhaps the rebooted sons-cc. It's been up for about a day now.</p>

<p>I RDPed to sons-cc and CC Doctor complained about a version incompatibility between CC and CQ. Looked around on sons-cc - there's no CQ installed there! Why was it removed?</p>

<p>Hmmm... I RDPed to sons-clearcase. Seems it's only been up 3 hours! Must have been recently rebooted....</p>

<p>It seems that a packet was lost somewhere. This is the complicated to do and complicated to explain procedure of setting epoch numbers back in time so as to replay the transactions and get everyone in the replica family on the same page...</p>

<p>I think I got it all straightened out now...</p>
