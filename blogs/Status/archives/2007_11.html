  <li>Released UCMWB 1.2.4</li>

</ul>
                              
                              <p>Interesting results here. I changed my comptree utility from repeatedly executing cleartool, which is damn slow!, to using IPC. Even if the OS caches the executable setting up a process must take some time. Here are the results:</p>

<div class=code><pre>
comptree v1.5 run at 20071120@17:17 with the following options:
Using exec cleartool
...
34936 elements compared successfully
Errors: 0 Warnings 0
Finished in <b>2 hours 25 minutes 57 seconds</b>
</pre></div>

<p>Whereas using IPC (i.e. starting cleartool and feeding it commands and reading the output, using Expect) yields:</p>

<div class=code><pre>
comptree v1.5 run at 20071120@16:46 with the following options:
Using IPC cleartool
...
34926 elements compared successfully
Errors: 0 Warnings 0
Finished in <b>27 minutes 51 seconds</b>
</pre></div>

<p>This is an 8 fold increase in time!</p>

<p>Oh, and /prj/muosran/Build/P4.0.24_SwitcherConfigSpecs/RncSolarisTB.cs compares with no errors and is ready for you to test.</p>

                     <h2 class="date-header">November  2, 2007</h2>
                     <a id="a000690"></a>
                     <div class="entry" id="entry-690">
                        <h3 class="entry-header">UCMWB 1.2.4</h3>
                        <div class="entry-content">
                           <div class="entry-body">
                              <ul>
  <li>Releasing ucmwb 1.2.4 for a test drive</li>
</ul>
                              
                              <p>I've reached another milestone in ucmwb development and would like your input on the new features as well as any bugs you might encounter. Please consider this beta. You can access this new version as usual with ucmwbpre.</p>

<p>Here are some of the changes implemented:</p>

<ul>
  <li><font color="#009900"><b>Progress dialogs work much better</b></font>.
As you know ucmwb is pretty slow starting up. Unfortunately until we
update our Oracle server from 9.x -&gt; 10.x I can do little to improve
start up time. Meantime, while start up is happening at least a
progress dialog box is shown to give the user some indication of where
are are in startup. Alas the majority of the start up is a large,
complicated query to get all WORs. One thing that is unknown is why a
query of 5000 records takes ~30 seconds whereas a query of 1000 records
in the test database happens in a few seconds.</li>
  <li><font color="#009900"><b>Environment variables for testing.</b></font>
There are 4 environment variables that could be set to point ucmwb to
the test Clearquest database. If not set then things point to
production. To point things to the test Clearquest database do all of
the following:<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#3333ff"><tt>% setenv OCI_USER RANTS8<br>
% setenv OCI_PASSWORD RANTS8<br>
% setenv CQ_DBSET XTST3</tt></font><br>
    <br>
Additionally, if you don't have a login to the XTST3 database you can
set:<br>
    <br>
    <tt><font color="#3333ff">% setenv CQ_USER ccadm<br>
% setenv CQ_PASSWORD ccadm</font><br>
    </tt><br>
  </li>
  <li><b><font color="#009900">cqtool Perl script replaces unsupported
and going away in 7.0 cqtool by IBM/Rational</font></b>. The new cqtool
Perl script now covers all aspects of the old, unsupported and going
away, cqtool from IBM/Rational. This is used to transition WORs into
different states, update effort ours as well as adding new
functionality for creating new WORs, child WORs and Help Desk Tickets.
The new cqtool is also run along side of ucmwb so subsequent usage of
cqtool will not have to reopen the Clearquest database, etc.</li>
  <li><b><font color="#cc0000">RANCQ0001589</font>: Allow state changes
from right-click menu in UCM Workbench</b>. You can now transition
state directly by right clicking on a WOR and selecting the next state
transition. Previously you need to to right click, bring up the
Properties and then click a button to get to the next state.</li>
  <li><b><font color="#cc0000">RANCQ00014935</font>: Allow the UCM
Workbench to create WOR from Collector</b>. The previously
unimplemented <i>Create Child WOR</i> action now works.</li>
  <li>Create WOR button/menu pick. With implementation of cqtool and
the Create Child WOR functionality comes the ability to create a plain
WOR. As such there is a new button on the tool bar for this as well as
a menu pick (<b>File: Create WOR</b>). Question: Should <b>Create WOR</b>
allow you to create a <i>Collector WOR</i>?</li>
  <li><b><font color="#cc0000">RANCQ00018139</font>: Changes for the
View Browser in the UCM Workbench</b>. The <i>View Browser</i> now
lists all views for the current owner (as defined in the <b>Filter
Settings: Owner field</b>). This change necessitated a painstaking and
slightly long task of enumerating all views with cleartool lsview -long
and then collecting exactly who really owns which views. By default
ucmwb will show the current users views, however you can change the <b>Owner
    </b>field in the <b>Filter Settings</b> to any user you want and
refresh the <i>View Browser</i> window. The collection of view owners
is determined whenever the <i>View Browser</i> window is opened or
after deletion of a view.<br>
    <br>
By default then the <b>View List Filter</b> box in the <i>View Browser</i>
is set to blank. You can now further narrow down the list of views
presented by typing in that filter box. Given the list of owned views
then you can further narrow the list of views down to only those
containing whatever string you type into the <b>View List Filter</b>
box,<br>
    <br>
Note you can deselect the <b>Filter Settings: Owner</b> field meaning
"all owners" and then the <i>View Browser</i> will start with a list
of all views, which you can further narrow down with the <b>View List
Filter</b> box.<br>
    <br>
Finally, this ticket requests a mechanism to delete multiple views.
Multi selection is now available on the view list. Drag to select
multiple views or use Shift-Click to extend the selection or
Control-Click to select non contiguous items. Once the views have been
selected you can click on the <b>Delete View(s)</b> button. If
multiple views are selected you will be asked once if you really wish
to delete all of these views. Views will then be forcefully deleted
(i.e. no prompting). If, however, only one view is selected (i.e. the
old fashioned method) then you will be prompted as before for
confirmation and notifed of possible problems (i.e. this view has view
privates...) along the way.</li>
  <li><font color="#009900"><b>Disable buttons for Change List and View
Private Files</b></font>. This was not officially submitted as a ticket
but Ken asked for it. You can now disable displaying of the <b>Change
List</b> and/or <b>View Private Files</b>. If both are disabled then
nothing is done. If either one of them are enabled then when a view is
selected it will be started and that <b>Change List</b> or <b>View
Private Files</b> area will be evaluated (i.e. ct lsact or ct lspriv).
This is useful if you have views that have lots of <b>Change List</b>
or <b>View Private Files</b> entries that will take time to evaluate.
If all you want to do is to delete these views, for example, then you
probably don't want to spend time enumerating the <b>Change List</b>
or <b>View Private Files</b> areas.</li>
  <li><b><font color="#cc0000">RANCQ0001781</font>: UCM Workbench not
recognizing WOR view</b>. This was fixed before. The problem was that
the WOR was in the midst of a rebase or deliver. I had coded this up
but somehow those changes became lost! They are now back in.</li>
</ul>
<font color="#ff0000"><b>Important Note:</b></font> ucmwb stores the
path to cqtool in your ~/.ucmwbrc. Currently that points to
/opt/rational/clearquest/bin/cqtool, the unsupported and going away
version of cqtool. The new ucmwb 1.2.4 will sense this and replace it
with
/cleartrig/ent/SNSD/muos/ccadm_tools/vobs/ranccadm/scripts/clearquest/cqtool.
If you are a ucmwb user you will want to set this back before going
back to use the current ucmwb.<br>
