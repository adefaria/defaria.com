                              <p>Dang IDEs! They're often more trouble than they are worth!! Be wary!</p>

<p>I'm in Eclipse and I was trying to clean up my view a little bit. I selected a few view private files I wanted to delete with Control-Click. Then I hit the delete key to delete them. Eclipse prompted me "Are you sure you want to delete these files?" and I responded yes. But then I noticed that one of the files that was selected was mktriggers.pl!!! I did not select mktriggers.pl explicitly - it was selected because that was the last file I was editing was mktriggers.pl. And, remember, I only expected this delete to be deleting the view private files I selected, not Clearcase elements. I did not expect any rmnames to be happening.</p>

<p>No worries you say? This is in Clearcase you say? Yes it was. But it was also checked out and with my most recent modifications. "Ah", I hear you saying, "Clearcase shouldn't be doing any explicit destructive activities without asking you first" - well it just did! It rmnamed mktriggers.pl without confirmation. Sure it asked whether or not I wanted to remove files, and I did, the ones I explicitly selected - not the one it had selected simply because I was editing a file. "Well shouldn't there be an option on rmname that you have to specify in order for rmname to proceed?" Yes there is - it's -force and good old Eclipse must have called rmname with -force!</p>

<p>"But surely there's a .keep file around or something that you can recover from". Well ah, no. Not in this case. My work has been lost!</p>

<p>You have been warned!</p>

  <li>Met with ??? regarding QC synchronization</li>

  <li>Documented duplicate code problems</li>

                              <h2>Issues with getsysid.pl</h2>

<p>There is a script called getsysid.pl which will get stuff from the Tandem and ftp it locally. The hope was that we could just get stuff back from the Tandem and then use something like diff -r to compare things. There are some issue with that:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Since files are coming off the Tandem their extensions are lost. Therefore while it may be foo.c when in Clearcase, it's just foo when it gets to the Tandem and thus when it comes back from the Tandem it's also just foo. diff -r will not be matching up foo and foo.c</li>

  <li>Typically views on Windows in <i>transparent</i> mode retain their CRLF characteristics. In other words they are in "DOS" mode. Files come back from the Tandem however are in "Unix" mode. This makes every line report as different from diff!</li>

  <li>There's the issue of these "squiggle" lines where version information is encoded in Clearcase and filled in on the Tandem (or visa versa). This lines, of course, will compare differently. Ugh!</li>
</ol>

<p>Perhaps a tool that can take these differences into account...</p>

  <li>Found out that the m_pPerl != 0 bug is fixed by install package on SCM Tools page</li>

  <li>Went through exercise with Randy of merging directories to allow backporting of code to an earlier release. General procedure is to use the Version Tree to select the appropriate parent directory, right click, merge to... and select the current view's version. Merge everything from the current view <b>except</b> the files that are to be backported. THis gets you an empty copy of the right OID. Then the user needs to do the same procedure with the individual files to get the content.</li>

  <li>Made some progress with mktriggers.pl</li>

  <li>Spoke with Jason more. It seems the .vbs script are indeed updating a QC database - one with "clearquest" in the name but a QC database nonetheless</li>

  <li>Described how to use dynamic views in Eclipse</li>
</ul>
                              
                              <h3>Eclipse plugin support for Clearcase<br></h3>

<p>There are 3 plugins that I see in my Eclipse environment. You can see them by selecting <b>Help: Software Updates: Manage Configuration</b>. Expand the C:\Program Files\Eclipse (or wherever you put Eclipse). You'll see the following Clearcase related plugins:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Rational Clearcase MVFS Support 7.0.0.200801131A: I think this is what supports dynamic views</li>

  <li>Rational Clearcase Remote Client for Eclipse 7.0.1.D061004: I think this is what supports web views or CCRC<br></li>

  <li>Rational Clearcase SCM Adapter 7.0.0.20061206A: I think this is just an adapter that translates Clearcase CM commands to Eclipse - which can use Clearcase or CVS or SVN, etc.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Accessing an existing dynamic view in Eclipse</h3>

<p>When you are in Eclipse with the above plugins many operations seem to be CCRC focused. For example, attempting to join a UCM project will lead you down a path to creating a CCRC or webview. Also, things like <b>Clearcase: Create Clearcase View</b> start with 1) a dialog box that says <b>Create Base Clearcase View</b> and asks to <b>Select a Clearcase Web Server for the view</b>. But you can create dynamic views outside the context of Eclipse and then use them in Eclipse.</p>

<p>Assuming you made a view by joining a project say from the Project Explorer, select <b>File: New Project</b>, expand <b>General</b> and then select <b>Project</b> and <b>Next</b>.</p>

<img src="/blogs/Status/images/NewProject.png" alt="New Project Dialog box">

<p>Give your project a name, toggle off <b>Use Default Location</b> and browse to your view mounted under the M drive and into a vob (must be done in some vob):</p>

<img src="/blogs/Status/images/NewProject2.png" alt="New Project Dialog 2">

<p>Click <b>Finish</b>. If you get the following dialog box then click <b>Cancel.</b></p>

<img src="/blogs/Status/images/AddElement.png" alt="Add Element">

<p>This may be required. In Eclipse select <b>Window: Preferences</b> and then filter by "mvfs". If necessary click on <u>Workspace</u> and <b>Apply</b> then do <b>Windows: Preferences</b> again and click on <b>Enable ClearCase dynamic view file system support</b>.</p>

<img src="/blogs/Status/images/MVFSPreferences.png" alt="MVFS Preferences">

<p>You should see Eclipse <b>Refreshing Workspace</b> running in the background. I'm not 100% what that's doing (getting Clearcase attributes to cache them?)</p>

<p>You should be able to right click on your newly created project (GDN_6.6.3 in the example above) and select<b> Team</b> then things like <b>Show Version Tree</b> or <b>Compare with Previous Version</b> etc.</p>

                              <ul>
  <li>Created 3 UCM Projects/streams - one including an Import Project component</li>

  <li>Investigated what causes users to be considered Clearcase Admins</li>
</ul>
                              
                              <p>A question was asked about what causes users to be considered Clearcase admins:</p>

<p>From <a
 href="http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21143292">About
ClearCase permissions on Windows</a>:<br>
<blockquote><b>ClearCase Administrative Access</b><br>
  <br>
Privileged users in ClearCase have rights to create, modify, and delete
any ClearCase object. Access to these permissions should be restricted
to ClearCase Administrators and the ClearCase Process Account (Atria
Location Broker Service - ALBD). Access is controlled by membership in
the ClearCase Administrators group.<br>
  <br>
This group which is designated during the setup and installation of
ClearCase is referred to as the ClearCase privileged group. By default,
this group is called <i>clearcase</i>. Some defining characteristics
of the ClearCase (or privileged) group are:<br>
  <ul>
    <li type="disc"><b>The account under which whose identity Atria
Location Broker Daemon (ALBD) runs has to be a member of this group,
such as </b><b><i>clearcase_albd</i></b><b>.</b><br>
    </li>
    <li type="disc">This group has Full Control of the view and VOB
storage directories.<br>
    </li>
    <li type="disc">Members of this group are considered ClearCase
Administrators.</li>
  </ul>
  <br>
  <b>Note</b>: The ClearCase privileged group must never be used as the
primary group on a VOB or set as a primary group for ClearCase access.<br>

</blockquote>
And from <a
 href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/rational/library/1111.html">ClearCase
administration: The first ten things</a>:<br>
<blockquote>The ClearCase administrator is the most powerful user
having full control of a site installation. On Unix, this would be the
superuser, UID=0, on the VOB server. On Windows, it is any user who is
a member of the <i>clearcase</i> domain group.<br>
</blockquote>
proving, once again, that root is everything on Unix!<br>
<br>
So now you know...</p>

  <li>Weekly high level status meeting with Dave and Rob. Focusing on SDDLS & Uncheckout problem</li>

  <li>Solved another evil twin case with Marlene</li>

  <li>Submitted helpdesk ticket to get Anthony added to the proper NIS group. They can have a Unix account but not be given access to Unix itself. So, ypmatch &lt;username> passwd will show them but id will not. This is because they are not in the users_seattle_clearcase_users NIS netgroup so thus they are not considered a user on this Unix system. Still have yet to figure out how they do Samba here...</li>
