                        <h3 class="entry-header">More woes with 2003 Server and sshd</h3>
                        <div class="entry-content">
                           <div class="entry-body">
                              <p>I don't see how my tinkering with things could have messed up IPSEC. I did mess with the Local Computer Polices and Default Domain Policies attempting to add rights to the local user sons-sc-cc\sshd_server. I'm not sure how this effects IPSEC. This user is used by the sshd and inetd Cygwin services. Since these services need to "switch user" to the user ssh'ing or rsh'ing they need some elevated rights. Prior to 2003 Server the Local System Account (known as SYSTEM in Cygwin) had enough rights to do this. But with 2003 Server Microsoft lessened the rights that the Local System Account has. Cygwin's answer to this is to create a new user ID, sshd_server, and assign it the necessary rights to be able to switch user. Then this user would only be used for Cygwin services. In fact they have a script /bin/ssh-host-config which creates a local sshd_server user for you (as well as sets up the hosts ssh key and adds a service for sshd). However even after running that script ssh was not working.</p>

<p>The inetd service, which is the <i>super server</i>, provides services like rsh, telnet, ftp, etc. that also needs to switch user. Similarly with cron. You see the service is running as an executable under some users credentials (normally the SYSTEM user) and needs to become the requesting user. So I was trying to run these services by using the local sshd_server user that ssh-host-config creates and adds the necessary rights to switch user.</p>

<p>Since I was having troubles I was removing the locally created sshd_server user and having the ssh-host-config script recreate it. At one time I decided to run mmc and add the Group Policy snap in then go under Local Computer Policy: Computer Configuration: Windows Settings: Local Policies: User Rights Assignment and make that the local sshd_server user had the following rights:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Create a token object</li>

  <li>Logon as a service</li>

  <li>Replace a process level token</li>

  <li>Increase Quota</li>
</ol>

<p>One time, when adding the Group Policy Object Editor I decided to click
on the Browse button and saw a Default Domain Policy and thought perhaps there was something in there overriding the Local Computer Policy. So I added that and again I made sure that sons-sc-cc\sshd_server had the above rights. I have put a copy of this mmc polices thing under C:\Polcies.msc in case Ron wants to look at it. I notice a number of SIDs in there, probably from my past creations and recreations of  sons-sc-cc\sshd_server.</p>

<p>As I don't know what Ron did to get sons-sc-cc running again and as I
see the local sshd_server as having only deny network login right I don't want to mess with anything. Right now rsh is still broken as inetd cannot switch user since it's using the sshd_server user and that user doesn't have enough rights.</p>

<p>Here's an exert from /usr/share/doc/Cygwin/openssh.README:</p>

<blockquote>
  <h3>Important note for Windows 2003 Server users:</h3>

  <p>2003 Server has a funny new feature. When starting services under SYSTEM account, these services have nearly all user rights which SYSTEM holds... except for the "Create a token object" right, which is needed to allow public key authentication :-(</p>

  <p>There's no way around this, except for creating a substitute account which has the appropriate privileges.  Basically, this account should be member of the administrators group, plus it should have the following user rights:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Create a token object</li>

    <li>Logon as a service</li>

    <li>Replace a process level token</li>

    <li>Increase Quota</li>
  </ol>

  <p>The ssh-host-config script asks you, if it should create such an account, called "sshd_server".  If you say "no" here, you're on your own.  Please follow the instruction in ssh-host-config exactly if possible.  Note that ssh-user-config sets the permissions on 2003 Server machines dependent
of whether a sshd_server account exists or not.</p>

                              <h3>Regarding sons-sc-cc's crontab</h3>

<p>I copied (and modified) the crontab for ccadmin@sons-clearcase -&gt; ccadmin@sons-sc-cc changing sons-clearcase -&gt; sons-sc-cc where appropriate. I had also commented out the ctmerge lines. We don't want to be doing ctmerges on sons-sc-cc just yet as sons-sc-cc doesn't yet master the branches that sons-clearcase does. If we did we'd have to establish a whole new branching structure like sc_1.0, etc. That would be doable but since sons-clearcase will be decommissioned I think it's cleaner to simple transfer mastership of everything over to sons-sc-cc. However before we can do that we need to get all the users off of sons-clearcase and using sons-sc-cc.</p>

<p>The only thing currently left in ccadmin's crontab on sons-sc-cc are:</p>

<div class=code><pre>
00 02 * * * //sons-sc-cc/Views/official/Tools/bin/update_view -q official

00 00 * * * /usr/bin/find /tmp -type f -ctime +3 -exec rm -f {} \;

01 03 * * Sat //sons-sc-cc/Views/official/Tools/adm/bin/dum -s /dev/d/Views/* &gt; /tmp/viewspace.log
</pre></div>

<p>These three things are mostly administrative, updating the view official, cleaning out old files in /tmp and doing a report of the size of the snapshot views -&gt; /tmp/viewspace.log. Sons-clearcase also does that. The report has the disk usage of all of the folders in the Views share sorted by the biggest users.</p>

<h3>Regarding checking in files/directories and cleaning views</h3>

<p>As we move off of sons-clearcase and onto sons-sc-cc you should instruct the engineers in Santa Clara to do the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Check in all files and directories in your views</li>

  <li>Check for any view private files you may wish to keep and save them somewhere</li>

  <li>For each view you own and that you have cleaned out with #1 and #2 above, remove it. If you have problems then see the Clearcase Administrator</li>
</ol>

<p>This goes for both snapshot views on the server (//sons-clearcase/Views) and local snapshot views on your desktop as well as any dynamic views you may have. It is not required that you remove local snapshot views however by removing the snapshot views on the server (//sons-clearcase/Views) we get a better picture of what views remain.</p>

<p>When all of your elements have been successfully checked in, all your view private files saved and all of your views removed you can switch to the new server by executing
/view/official/Tools/bin/switch-sons-sc-cc at a Cygwin prompt. Close any of your Clearcase tools (e.g. Clearcase Explorer) first. Then start Clearcase Explorere and create new views and proceed with your work. If you saved view private files and wish to restore them then copy them from the saved locations into a newly created view.</p>

<h3>What are view private files and why are they possibly important?</h3>

<p>We all know what file/directory elements are and what a checked out file/directory is. View private files are files in your view that have not been added to source control. These can be the result of a compile (e.g. foo.o AKA a derived object because they have been derived and can be re-derived if necessary) or they can be simply a file that you
created (e.g. file.txt). Sometimes you may create a view private file that you want to keep, possibly wanting to add it to source control at some later time. You generally don't need to worry about derived objects (IOW you can regenerate foo.o provided foo.c is in source control). But if you say created some new files that you use in the build but have not yet added them to source control, but intend to, then you obviously want to keep them. Perhaps it's time to add them to source control...</p>

<p>To list view private files use:</p>

<div class=code><pre>
$ ct lsco
</pre></div>

<p>In your view.</p>

<h3>Checking what's still checked out</h3>

<p>Most people know how to Find Checkout. But to find all checkouts easily
from a command line you can do:</p>

<div class=code><pre>
$ ct lsco -avobs
</pre></div>

<p>Again this needs to be done in a view context (cd /view/official for example). This way you can see what's left to check in for everybody. We're aiming for 0!

                              <h3>Attempting to transfer databases using MS Access</h3>

<p>OK, trying this methodology:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Used installutil copyschemarepo command to copy schema.db -&gt;
schema.mdb</li>
  <li>Moved schema.mdb to new server</li>
  <li>Used installutil copyuserdb command to copy salira_test.db -&gt;
test.db.</li>
  <li>Moved test.db to new server</li>
  <li>Tried several times to use installutil command to copy
salira_bugs.db (the production database) -&gt; bugs2.db. System aborted
several times. Not sure if this is due to bad disk blocks or not. This
is a major problem as this is the data we care about.</li>
</ul>

<p>Back on the new server:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If I do Connection: New and point to the schema.mdb file it wants
to overwrite it! Instead I did File: Import Profile of a profile of the
old databases. Of course these say SQL_ANYWHERE. I change this to
MS_ACCESS and point to the schema.mdb file and this seems to work.</li>
  <li>Attempt to do Schema Repository: Move. In doing so I set the
Physical Database Name by browsing to the folder via the ellipsis
button. This leaves me with D:\Clearquest\schema.db. Clicking on Finish
give ms:<br>
    <blockquote>The filename you have specified is not a Share. If
other users will need access to this database, you should browse
through "Network Neighborhood" to place is in a share. Continue with
this name?<br>
    </blockquote>
I select No because I do want other users to be able to access this
database. Next I change the D:\Clearquest\salira.db -&gt;
\\sons-sc-cc\Clearquest\schema.db and click Finish. At this point I get
a error dialog stating that it was "Unable to connect to the database
server". After much scratching of the head I realize that I should use
D:\Clearquest\schema.db, ignore the warning, then go back in and set
the Physical Database Name to \\sons-sc-cc\Clearquest\schema.db.<br>
    <br>
Oh, a side issue: After failing using a Physical Database Name of
\\sons-sc-cc\Clearquest\schema.db the Rational Clearquest Maintenance
Tool still creates a schema.db file. If you go Back and correct the
Physical Database Name to a local path and click Finish you'll get a
database I/O error. Turns out you have to remove this schema.db file
first. These two (what else could I call them but) BUGS caused me to
lose many hours of sleep.<br>
    <br>
Managed to move the schema.mdb -&gt; schema.db.</li>
  <li>Switching to the Clearquest Designer now to Database: Update User
Database Properties. As I only have the test.mdb file to convert I
change the user database properties for the test database.</li>
  <li>Now I select Database: Move User Database to move the test user
database to SQL_ANYWHERE</li>
</ul>

<p>At this point I'd like to run Clearquest Designer and do Test Work so I
can at at least verify that I can access the converted to SQL_ANYWHERE
test.db. Unfortunately there is a checked out version of the schema in
the schema database that I copied over and I'm not the owner of that
checked out schema. And I can't login as that user.</p>

<p>By chance I tried Schema Repository: Upgrade: Selected connection in
the Clearquest Maintenance Tool and in stepping through those dialog
boxes it say "The schema repository that you want to upgrade has
checked-out schemas. If you continue the upgrade process, the checked
out schema versions cannot be upgraded and will be deleted from the
system". I continue onward and manage to "upgrade" the schema and test
database. I proceed into Clearquest Designer and manage to Test Work
and viola! I got it up. I am nothing if not tenacious!</p>

  <li>Instructions given from Rational spoke of converting databases on a single server. This is not what we are doing there. Tried various things in an attempt to extend the directions to two servers and get the installutil command to run. Nothing was working.</li>

  <li>Scoured the Rational documents and the net for "preparedbforupgrade" - turned up little except some guys personal web site talking about how the <i>Rational Suite - Upgrade Guide</i> describes the upgrade procedure with two servers and here's the single server procedure. That's nice, and it's pretty much the exact technote that the Rational support engineer pointed me to. However where's the double server procedure!</li>

  <li>Scoured the Rational site, this time for <i>Rational Suite - Upgrade Guide</i>. Found it! It was a in a pdf file! Apparently the Rational site search engine doesn't search inside pdf files. They should take a lesson from Google! Also searched the system for this pdf file (rs_upgrade.pdf) and it was not on the system. Now why isn't it part of what gets installed?</li>

  <li>Started doing the steps for converting the database as described in the <i>Rational Suite - Upgrade Guide</i>. See below for more.</li>

                              <p>After speaking to Ron and getting the remote access working I did a few more things last night I:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Installed Clearcase. After Ron had changed the name of the machine to sons-sc-cc all was fine with the Clearcase installation. And multitool (Multisite's cleartool) is even there!</li>

  <li>Installed the Clearcase patch so you're totally up to date.</li>

  <li>Installed Clearquest</li>

  <li>Copied over \\sons-clearcase\Tools -> \\sons-sc-cc\Tools</li>

  <li>Installed and configured Cygwin. This took a while to get all the config stuff there, etc. Created a \\sons-sc-cc\Tools\Cygwin local package area. Sons-sc-cc has the latest Cygwin now.</li>

  <li>Created Clearcase stgloc's for Vobs and Views</li>

  <li>Created empty shell vobs for salira, salira2, tools and hardware. These will be where I Multisite to.</li>

  <li>Defragged drives on new machine.</li>

  <li>Made sure sons-sc-cc was up to date with WindowsUpdate.</li>
</ul>

<p>Tonight I intend to create the initial replica packets for the vobs then ship them over to sons-sc-cc and setup Multisite syncing. I will first Multisite a vob like Tools or perhaps hardware just to go through the procedure and get the syncing jobs set up. Then I will do both salira and salira2.</p>

<p>There's probably still loose ends that need to be looked at but my plan is basically to be able to build in salira (I don't know how to build in salira2!) using only sons-sc-cc.</p>

<p>At that point we could create some views there for say Simon and teach him how to switch regions to the new SC region. Then he'd be working with the new vob server. He could build and otherwise check it out.</p>

  <li>Cleaned up web area on sonsweb</li>

  <li>Added link for old 2.3 releases</li>

  <li>Created 3.1.1.8.bugs file</li>

  <li>Explained to Shuqing how the whole set up worked</li>

  <li>Created china_3.1.lst file for Shanghai. Changes to CheckInPreop.pl will replicate to Shanghai and should become effective tomorrow.</li>

  <li>Investigated changing <b>Found In</b> and <b>Fixed In</b> dropped downs to be sorted in reverse order since they are working on the latest, therefore highest numbered releases first. Turns out this will require more work with a possible change to the Clearquest schema. Jeff has schema checked out so I couldn't do anything. Basically those fields tie into a stateless record which contains a <b>Release ID</b> and a <b>Description</b>. I'm not sure how to tell Clearquest to sort that drop down.</li>

                              <p>Fixed bug in build_view:</p>

<p>Fixed problem counting errors in output. This is a common problem: How do you distinguish between real errors and file elements or variable that contain the string "error". The approach was:</p>
   
<tt>
errors=$(grep -i error $card.build.log | grep -v "Errors: 0" | grep -vc "cli_errors.c")
</tt>
   
<p>which looks for errors in general, weeds out the "Errors: 0" that the NP complier puts out and then makes an exception for the file element named cli_errors.c. Well with onu2311 comes new output that contains the string "error" but is not an error. Notably:</p>
   
<tt>
dmt_main.c: In function `reportErrorPort':<br>
dmt_main.c:274: warning: implicit declaration of function `resetPortErrorCounts'
</tt>
   
<p>For now we will make an exceptions for "ErrorPort" and "PortError" but this is not an ideal solution to the problem in general.</p>

                              <p>Was trying to get all of my WebSAM testing completed but was not able to. Got kicked onto another test system and that one had problems. Luckily Asad and Jeff helped fix things up for me. Got a lot done but may need to do more tomorrow.</p>

<h3>2.3.0.4 releaseed</h3>

<p>2.3.0.4 bring in the FX branch into the 2.3 release line. It also has fairly major functionality identified by bug ID 3605 (287 elements changed!) and a new card, onu2311.</p>

<p>Please let me know when you guys and gals make a new card! While updating the makefile will indeed insure that the new card is build when one types make, I use scripts and processes that rely on the definition of <i>cards</i> defined in /Tools/adm/etc/cards and need to update that file when a new card appears. Thanks.</p>

<p>Regarding the FX branch: The FX branch was a temporary branch for engineers to work on until 2.3 stablized. As such, with it's successful merge I plan on <font color="red"><b>destroying</b></font> both us_fx and china_fx branches. A destroy means that <i>the branch, element versions on that branches,  any labels on those element versions and merge arrows to and from the FX branches will <b>disappear</b></i>. It will be as if suddenly a bunch of new FX related code got checked into the 2.3 release line. Since the FX branch was indeed temporary I don't see any problem with destroying it though. Let me know if you have any objection to this.</p>

<p>Before I destroy the FX branches however Hok has to check in his code and merge it to 2.4.</p>

<li>Performed more testing of WebSAM. Didn't get very far because I encountered some sort of hardware problem that Asad got me out of (partitially). Still seem to have some misbehaving cards. Don't seem to have a PTC card in this system nor any ONUs. Must look into this more tomorrow.</li>

<li>Fixed bug in trigger for real this tiem. It was not as indicated above. We did not need extra "\"'s rather we needed to remove the "2> /dev/null" redirection as that is a Unix'ism and ActiveState Perl, which is the Perl the Clearcase is invoking, doesn't like that syntax!</li>

<p>Meantime I've been trying to figure out why sometimes the build process says all is OK when there are build errors. Turns out to be a shell problem with tee. When building I'm doing:</p>

<pre>
$ make $card.sf 2>&1 | tee -a $teefile > $card.build.log
</pre>

<p>Seems this tee thing messes up the return code from make. This can be demonstrated simply by:</p>

<pre>
$ ls nonexistance_file 2>&1 | tee -a /tmp/ls.log > /tmp/ls2.log; echo $?
0
</pre>

<p>Need to figure out how to fix this...</p>

<p>Merged NeoPON.ccp from 2.2 -> 2.3 by drawing merge arrow. This was after Zhiyi OKed this merge.</p>

<p>Worked out remaining merge issues on other branches. These were largely "can't check in identical file" type problems.</p>

<p>Attempted an FX -> 2.3 merge. Only like 40 elements to merge but some manual merging was required. Due to 2.3.0.3 build for KDDI this was put on hold. Need to merge this then allow Hok to check in before destroying this branch.</p>

                              <p>Fixed bug in CheckInPost.pl. This bug was caused by an element having a space character in it (e.g. a directory named "source code"). The checkin trigger had the following line:</p>

<pre>
$result = system ("cleartool mklabel -replace $bugid $pname");
</pre>

<p>This line assumes that $pname does not contain a space character. The fix was:</p>

<pre>
$result = system ("cleartool mklabel -replace $bugid \"$pname\"");
</pre>

<p>The \"'s surround $pname and thus protect it.</p>

                              <p>Shirley/Ying approached me today asking to merge the us_fx branch into the rel_2.3 branch. As rel_2.3 has not be stablized yet (2.3.0.1 has not be officially built) I was hesitant and suggested instead ot merge the reL_2.3 branch into the us_fx. This caused a massive amount of merging (561 elements) probably due to the fact that lots of stuff changed in reL_2.3 that the FX engineers did not care about (other areas of the platform code as well as the web pages, SAM, etc). There were a few elements that require manual merging. Shirley is aware of these.</p>

                              <p>I decided to check sons-clearcase after Ron implemented his fix for our router problems. Turns out I can't access it again. Not sure if it's the router, the fix or something else. I can VPN into my desktop. I can ping servers such as sonscentral and sonsservices but not sons-clearcase. I tried pinging the gateway and it still dropping packets.

<p>Then when I was attempting to ping sons-clearcase I got the following:

<pre>
$ ping sons-clearcase

Pinging sons-clearcase.SALIRA.COM [192.168.0.99] with 32 bytes of data:

<p>Not sure what this means. Guess I'm gonna have to drive into work again...

<p>Checked sons-clearcase from home and couldn't get to it. Drove in and analyzed the situation. Saw things in the Event Viewer possibly indicating that the network card was bad. Rebooted machine. Couldn't get it up on the network. Ran network trouble shooter and it suggested replacing the network cable. Didn't want to do that. It also suggested to try to plug the network cable into another spot on the hub. Tried that and it worked! Not sure if that was the fix or if sons-clearcase's network card is flaking out. Rebooted once again to come up clean.

                              <p>Went in around 3 PM. Rebooted sons-clearcase. It's back up and running. Noticed that our backups are not really working well (never have been actually). Performed backup by hand.</p>

<p>BackupExec doesn't seem to want to properly do the pre and post commands necessary to backup the vobs. It seems to say that it can execute the cleartool lock command on the remote machine but always fails with an error stating that the pre command failed.</p>

<p>What was really confusing about this is that the Tools vob backup appears to work. Well then I found out that the Tools vob backup was configured to run the pre command but accept non 0 as an OK status whereas the Salira vob was not accepting non 0 as an OK status.</p>

<p>In any event ct lock vob:\<vob> should return 0. In the Tools vob case the lock was not really happening. </p>

<p>Need to speak to Veritas regarding this on Monday and get this finally working correctly.</p>

<p>Meantime at least we have one good backup!</p>

                              <p>I saw some email saying that there was some possible problems with some Clearcase stuff and decided to investigate. I had talked with Ron on Friday and he is aware of our network problems. But today I could not contact sons-clearcase at all. I can seem to ping and otherwise contact other machines such as sonscentral, sonsservices and engineer's desktops such as dko and gtsang. I can even ping sons-cc in Shanghai! I fear there might be something wrong with sons-clearcase itself - perhaps the network card. Why can I contact other machines but not sons-clearcase?</p>

<p>Not sure if I should go in to reboot sons-clearcase and see if she comes up OK. I guess I oughta...</p>

<p>Hmmm... I can't ssh adefaria@adefaria either. Doesn't accept my password. ssh ccadmin@adefaria doesn't work either. Could this be an Active Directory problem too?</p>

<p>Was able to remote desktop to sonscentral. Doesn't seem like my account is locked. Neither is ccadmin. Can't tell if this network issue is just sons-clearcase or a larger problem.</p>
