<p><li>Continuing on with merge/build of US_FX branch. Seems this is impedding further development. There were 2 files that required manual merging. I was told to simply copy r_ingress.asmi from 2.3. I'm not particularly comfortable with that because there are merge issues for that file from the 2.2 branch.</li></p>

<p><li>Tried to figure out why 2.4 was not building onu2360. Seems that onu2360 was not included in the cards script (in /Tools/adm/etc) so the build process was not building it. Added it to cards</li></p>

                              <p>Shirley/Ying approached me today asking to merge the us_fx branch into the rel_2.3 branch. As rel_2.3 has not be stablized yet (2.3.0.1 has not be officially built) I was hesitant and suggested instead ot merge the reL_2.3 branch into the us_fx. This caused a massive amount of merging (561 elements) probably due to the fact that lots of stuff changed in reL_2.3 that the FX engineers did not care about (other areas of the platform code as well as the web pages, SAM, etc). There were a few elements that require manual merging. Shirley is aware of these.</p>
