                              <p>Was trying to get all of my WebSAM testing completed but was not able to. Got kicked onto another test system and that one had problems. Luckily Asad and Jeff helped fix things up for me. Got a lot done but may need to do more tomorrow.</p>

<h3>2.3.0.4 releaseed</h3>

<p>2.3.0.4 bring in the FX branch into the 2.3 release line. It also has fairly major functionality identified by bug ID 3605 (287 elements changed!) and a new card, onu2311.</p>

<p>Please let me know when you guys and gals make a new card! While updating the makefile will indeed insure that the new card is build when one types make, I use scripts and processes that rely on the definition of <i>cards</i> defined in /Tools/adm/etc/cards and need to update that file when a new card appears. Thanks.</p>

<p>Regarding the FX branch: The FX branch was a temporary branch for engineers to work on until 2.3 stablized. As such, with it's successful merge I plan on <font color="red"><b>destroying</b></font> both us_fx and china_fx branches. A destroy means that <i>the branch, element versions on that branches,  any labels on those element versions and merge arrows to and from the FX branches will <b>disappear</b></i>. It will be as if suddenly a bunch of new FX related code got checked into the 2.3 release line. Since the FX branch was indeed temporary I don't see any problem with destroying it though. Let me know if you have any objection to this.</p>

<p>Before I destroy the FX branches however Hok has to check in his code and merge it to 2.4.</p>

<li>Fixed bug in CheckinPostop.pl trigger. Seems we need to have a total of 4, count 'em, 4 "\" to equate to one "\" in Windows. Needed to change code to use "@\\\\salira" to indicate the salira vob.</li>

<li>Performed more testing of WebSAM. Didn't get very far because I encountered some sort of hardware problem that Asad got me out of (partitially). Still seem to have some misbehaving cards. Don't seem to have a PTC card in this system nor any ONUs. Must look into this more tomorrow.</li>

<li>Fixed bug in trigger for real this tiem. It was not as indicated above. We did not need extra "\"'s rather we needed to remove the "2> /dev/null" redirection as that is a Unix'ism and ActiveState Perl, which is the Perl the Clearcase is invoking, doesn't like that syntax!</li>

<li>Completed the FX merge!</li>

                              <p>Built 2.3.0.3. Not sure if it's officially done yet in that there may be some problems with the ONU2310 FPGA image.</p>

<p>Meantime I've been trying to figure out why sometimes the build process says all is OK when there are build errors. Turns out to be a shell problem with tee. When building I'm doing:</p>

<pre>
$ make $card.sf 2>&1 | tee -a $teefile > $card.build.log
</pre>

<p>Seems this tee thing messes up the return code from make. This can be demonstrated simply by:</p>

<pre>
$ ls nonexistance_file 2>&1 | tee -a /tmp/ls.log > /tmp/ls2.log; echo $?
0
</pre>

<p>Need to figure out how to fix this...</p>

<p>Merged NeoPON.ccp from 2.2 -> 2.3 by drawing merge arrow. This was after Zhiyi OKed this merge.</p>

<p>Worked out remaining merge issues on other branches. These were largely "can't check in identical file" type problems.</p>

<p>Attempted an FX -> 2.3 merge. Only like 40 elements to merge but some manual merging was required. Due to 2.3.0.3 build for KDDI this was put on hold. Need to merge this then allow Hok to check in before destroying this branch.</p>
