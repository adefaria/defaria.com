<li>Attempted to move Core_automation and EntData_ARCH vobs to prod01 but failed</li>

<li> Worked with security people to get vobadm password back</li>

<li>Worked a little to configure RWP for Perl CGI</li>

</ul>

<h3> Vob move problems</h3>

<p>First problem with the move of these vobs was that vobadm's password had changed. Therefore I had to perform this vob move in an unfamilar environment. Also, ownerships and permissions on these vobs are odd as they were done before we started standardizing things. As ccadmin1 I was eventually able to copy the vob storage but was not able to register these vobs at the new location.  Attempts to do so would fail with </p>

<div class="code">
cleartool: Error: Failed to record hostname "rtnlprod01" in storage directory<br>
"D:\vobstore\EntData_ARCH.vbs". Check that root or the ClearCase<br> administrators group has permission to write to this directory.<br>
</div>

<p>Even after changing ownerships this was still failing. I suggest we take soem time to get the ownerships and permissions standardized on these vobs in the Genuis region before we attempt to move them again (that and perhaps doing some test moving...)</p>

<h3>Vobadm password problems</h3>

<p>AFAICT somebody changed the vobadm password. Now I'm not pointing any fingers however nobody in our group did and the only other group who knows the vobadm password is...  Well you fill in the rest! Anyways, for some reason at about 3 Pm that somebody must have changed the password back.</p>

                              We need to change the Clearcase group from clearcase1 -> ccadmin in the registry of the Genius clients. Additionally we need to have the ALBD process started as Ameriquest\clearcase_albd and specify the proper password for the service to start. We can change the login for the service through the registry but I have not been able to find how to set the password correctly.

<li>M drive problem appears to be a networking problem at Eric's location</li>

<li>Condensed Client release areas to one release area</li>

<li>Attempted to access LDAP through Perl</li>

                              <h3>M drive problem appears to be a networking problem at Eric's location</h3>

<p>Today Eric sent over somebody to install and setup Weblogic on my desktop in an attempt to reproduce the problem with Jbuilder writing to the M drive. After much installation, setup and configuration the problem was not reproducable. IOW it worked like a champ from my desktop.</p>

<p>During the installation we copied over the VIP sources instead of using the sources in the vob and we got these from Eric's desktop. It took a very long time leading me to further believe that there are networking problems either on Eric's desktop or somewhere between his desktop and the servers.</p>

<h3>Condensed Client release areas to one release area</h3>

<p>On //rtnlprod03/CC_REL_2003.6 there exists the following client release areas:</p>

<ul>

<li>Training-client</li>
<li>asap-tavant-client</li>
<li>resolve-client</li>
<li>asap-integration-client</li>
<li>eag-client</li>
<li>scc-client</li>
<li>asap-qa-client</li>
<li>pmo-client</li>
<li>vip-client</li>

</ul>

<p>and a server area:</p>

<ul>

<li>pmo-server</li>

</ul>

<p>TUP exists at //rtnlprod03/sqldb/TUP and XDE-Java at //rtnlprod03/sqldb/XDE-Java.</p>

<p>The Clearcase client and server installation areas have all been condensed to one Server and one Client installation area (//rtnlprod03/CC_REL_2003.6/Server and Client). Instead we now have .reg file that set the uniquely different configuration settings for the various groups in the CM_TOOLS vob under etc with names like ASAP.reg, SCC.reg, EAG-ESB.reg. After a client install we will send a link to these files that will cause the settings to be installed on their desktop.</p>

<p>Currently the various client reg files have only the setting of Region, RegBackup and CLEARCASE_PRIMARY_GROUP.</p>

<h3>Attempted to access LDAP through Perl</h3>

<p>I installed Perl modules to deal with LDAP in the hopes of being able to set up a web page that will list out the membership of the various CC groups from Active Directory. Trouble is I do not know the server name of Active Directory nor the <i>distinguished name</i> to use in order to access this data.</p>

<li>Fixed the FAQ pages. Mike had switched rtnlprod02 over to using rwp. This broke the FAQ pages since they used Apache under Cygwin. Reported rwp to the old FAQ pages.</li>
