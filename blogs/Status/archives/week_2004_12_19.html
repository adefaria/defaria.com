                              <ul>

<li>Finished los178 build of sources with fixed copyrights!</li>

<li>Still an error with the non development build of los178 :-(</li>

<li>Made more progress on cmptags.pl (a Perl script to compare and report on the difference in terms of revisions and associated ECRs, authors and dates between two tags in CVS)</li>

</ul>
                              
                              <p>First I obtained the latest TOT for los178 - apparently they are still fixing things. This makes it imperative that fix_copyright.pl work flawlessly. Was able to build los178 from old, unmodified sources thus I know I'm starting from a good set of sources.</p>

<p>Next was to run fix_copyright.pl and attempt a compile. This time, instead of just hand editing the files I examined the file in question and why fix_copyright.pl failed in this case. Then fix fix_copyright.pl and repeat.</p>

<p>One problem was that some files have MS-DOS line endings. Fixed this by removing such line endings and making them standard Unix line endings.</p>

<p>Next some files ended the comment block with */ and then some additional spaces. This was fixed by not attempting to anchor the end comment block match with the end of the line (i.e. $).</p>

<p>Injected these actual two or three files back into the build process until it built.</p>

<p>For safety's sake I then destroyed my build area and recreated from scratch with cvs update -C then running fix_copyright.pl again and bringing that over to grumpy.</p>

<p>WRT cmptags.pl, made some more progress parsing cvs log info...</p>

<li>Still unable to build 3.2.2/5.0.0 natively</li>

<li>Worked on improving algorithm for copyright replacement</li>

</ul>
                              
                              <p>I'm finding it very difficult to develop a hueristic algorithm to find what I call "LynuxWorks copyright blocks" in existing source files. The problem is that the input data is not necessarily consistant. Sure we can go for the 80% fix and hand fix the rest (in fact, that's what I did before) however those 20% often cause compiler errors during the build. What's potential worse is that it is possible that some files will be altered in such a way as to not produce a compiler error but rather to change behavior of the resulting code.</p>

<p>My current algorithm attempts to do the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Locate the start of a C comment (i.e. "/*"). This comment must be at the beginning of the line (for now I am not considering inline comments as the chances of these containing a bona fide copyright statement is unlikely).</il>

  <li>Scan until the enclosing end comment (i.e. "*/"). Again this must appear at the end of a line ($).</li>

  <li>Take those lines and examine them for the works "(C) Copyright" and "LynuxWorks" (additionally I found some files that had "LynuxWork,").</li>

  <li>If found then the comment block it throw out (to be replaced by the new, more consistent copyright block.</li>

</ul>

<p>Currently the "official" copyright block is of the form:</p>

<div class="code">
<pre>
    /* vi: ts=4 sw=4
    *************************************************************
    (C) Copyright $copy
    LynuxWorks, Inc.
    San Jose, CA
    All rights reserved.

    $Date: $Date$
    $Revision: $Revision$
    $Source: $Source$
    ************************************************************/
</pre>
</div>

<p>The "$copy" is replaced by the copyright date found in the file. Dates of the form <year> are changed to <year>-<current year> (unless <year> == <current year>. Dates of the form <year1>, <year2>, <year3> are changed to <year1>-<curernt year>. In order to make finding such copyright information eaiser in the future I would suggest changing the above format to:</p>

<div class="code">
<pre>
    /* Start Copyright ******************************************
    vi: ts=4 sw=4
    (C) Copyright $copy LynuxWorks, Inc.
    San Jose, CA
    All rights reserved.

    $Date: $Date$
    $Revision: $Revision$
    $Source: $Source$
    * End Copyright *********************************************/
</pre>
</div>

<p>This would 1) retain the "vi: ts=4 sw=4" annotation that I assume is for vi users, 2) group both the copyright string ("(C) Copyright") along with the company name of LynuxWorks on the same line. This makes it easier to grep for in the future considering some files have Rockwell copyrights. 3) Clearly delineates the start and stop of the copyright block.</p>

<p>The problems that I'm having is that I'm seeing copyright blocks of the following forms:</p>

<div class="code">
