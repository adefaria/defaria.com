                              <p>Although some errors persisted in the 120604-C build I decided it was time to at least try a native PPC build of the toolchain. The problem here is the PPC machine that I was told to use, t-mcpn765-1, is a LynxOS 4.0.0 machine! I don't think I'm supposed to try to build a 3.2.2 toolchain for 4.0.0.</p>

<p>Additionally, I've never built the toolchain natively on a PPC machine before. Previously, when building the toolchain natively, one needed to extract things like X/Motif (according to my instructions - which may very well be off base - why would we need X/Motif to build a compiler?!?) and devos (I think). Where do I get such things?</p>

<p>Additionally, t-mcpn765-1 doesn't have enough disk space.</p>

                              <h3>Rebuilding of cross toolchain from 120604-B</h3>

<p>After building LynxOS 120604-B and only receiving a few errors about (see previous days entry) I decided to attempt to rebuild the toolchain again. This seemed to work OK!</p>

<h3>Building LynxOS 120604-C</h3>

<p>With the toolchain rebuilt I went to rebuild LynxOS 120604-C. At this point Dopey ran out of disk space. I moved the 120604-A subdirectory over to /export/build2/defaria temporarily because that filesystem had much more space.</p>

<h3>Toolchain tarball naming change</h3>

<h4>AKA, why one should always cvs checkout int_tools instead of just copying it</h4>

<p>There's been this nagging problem of int_tools not being able to find the proper toolchain tarball to install compilers. This we due to the fact that I've been copying int_tools from 120604-A -> 120604-B -> 120406-C. Well names have changed but the copies of int_tools didn't reflect that change! Plus, for some reason, somebody hand fixed 120604-B but 120604-C and -A had been refreshed from CVS. Moral of this story is to always use cvs checkout to get a fresh copy of int_tools.</p>

<div class="note">
  <p><b>Note:</b> This underscores one of the things that I do not like in CVS, that being the tendency of making many copies of what's in CVS due to it's snapshot view/sandbox like methodology. It's easy to see where one might create a 120604-C/int_tools directory via a cvs checkout int_tools and that int_tools be different than 120604-B and 120604-C's copies. If one then needs to make a change to int_tools and this change should apply to the -B and -C areas as well then one needs to remember about the -B and -C areas and remember to update them as well. This is a common problem with a snapshot/sandbox philosophy. Nevermind that it's wasteful to have so many multiple copies of essentially the same thing - wasteful in terms of diskspace and prone to misunderstanding and human error.</p>

  <li>Attempting to build 120604-B with this new toolchain</li>
</ul>
                              
                              <p>Adam helped me figure out that the reason that the toolchain was failing to build was because the ppc/lib directory in 120604-B didn't have the proper libraries. I proceeded to build the tookchain using 120604-A.</p>

<p>After successfully building the toolchain in 120604-A I proceeded to attempt to build LynxOS in 120604-B utilizing int_tools. The first problem that I had was that it attempts to install a compiler from DIR_PATH(compilers), which was set to 3.2.2-120604. But the toolchain I built for PPC was not there. Note that there was also a 3.2.2-122804 directory. I decided to use 3.2.2-122804 instead of 3.2.2-120604 and I scp'ed the toolchain I built over to that directory. The 3.2.2-122804 already had some toolchains in there but didn't have PPC toolchains.</p>

<p>After performing a make package for the toolchain I wound up with a toolchain-i686-pc-linux-gnu-powerpc.tar.gz. So I copied that over to 3.2.2-122804. But int_tools was looking for a toolchain-i-686-pc-linux-gnu-ppc.tar.gz. I solved this problem by symlinking. I also needed a toolchain-powerpc-lynx-lynxos-ppc.tar.gz or int_tools complained.</p>

<p>After fixing those problem I managed to build LynxOS but there were a few errors:</p>

<div class="code"><pre>

</pre></div>

<p>There are also some errors in demo.log.</p>

<p>Are these reasonable errors? Should I go one to attempt to build the PPC toolchain again using this LynxOS?</p>
