                              <h3>Determining CVS Read/Write Access</h3>

<p>CVS decides read/write access based on the presence of the user name in the files readers and writers in the repository. Additionally either or both of these files may be missing.</p>

<p>The CVS Manual says:</p>

<blockquote><i>
<p>If <tt>readers</tt> exists, and this user is listed in it, then the user gets read-only access. Or if <tt>writers</tt> exists, and this user is <b>not</b> listed in it, then they also get read-only access (this is true even if <tt>readers</tt> exists but they are not listed there). Otherwise, she gets full read-write access.</p>

<p>Of course there is a conflict if the user is listed in both files. This is resolved in the more conservative way, it being	better to protect the repository too much than too little: such a user gets read-only access.</p>
</i></blockquote>

<p>Based on that the following describe the access granted to a user.</p>

<ol>
  <li>A strict intepretation of the CVS manual might lead you to
believe that since readers does not exist and writers does not exist then it would fall into the "Otherwise" statement at the end of the first paragraph. However an argument can be made that the user is also not listed in the writers file because the writers file is not present. But I believe that no access should be granted.</li>

  <li>Readers does not exist and the user is not listed in writers
so read only access.</li>

  <li>Readers does not exist but the user is listed in writers. So
the user has write access. Does this imply read access? Does write-only access exist?</li>

  <li>User is not listed in the readers file and there is no writers
file. This case is not covered by the CVS manual. My assumption is therefore no access. Again a strict interpretation might argue the "Otherwise" clause but I think not.</li>

  <li>User is not listed in the readers file nor in the writers file
therefore read only access.</li>

  <li>User is not listed in the readers file but is listed in the
writers file. User gets read/write access.</li>

  <li>User is listed in the readers file but there is no writers
file. Read only access.</li>

  <li>User is listed in the readers file but not present in writers
file. Read only access.</li>

  <li>User is listed in the readers file and the writers file. This
is the conflict. Resolve the conflict by only providing read access.</li>
</ol>

  <li>Got password updating working</li>

  <li>Got it working such that the cookie setting code is working</li>

  <li>Implemented Admin mode for cvsroot user only. This allows the cvsroot user to manage other users, groups and sysusers</li>

  <li>Also when in admin mode the cvsroot user can set another persons password to something new without having to know the old password (i.e. password reset)</li>

  <li>Also when in admin mode the sysuser is exposed as a drop down - allowing cvsroot to change a sysuser for a user</li>

  <li>Still need to workout read/write access properly, other security issues (possibly a setuid script allowing the apache user to become cvsroot to re-write and/or check out and in files like passwd, readers and writers for repositories).</li>

  <li>Another issue is what to do as far as for paranoia checking. For example, what should happen if cvsroot attempts to remove say the "int" group and there are still users associated with the int group?</li>
