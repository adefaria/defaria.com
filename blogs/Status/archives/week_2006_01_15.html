                              <h2>CQ Web Email Problem when in the DMZ</h2>

<p>OK, here's what's going on. As you know we were having a problem with the email being sent out with a date of 2001. I looked into this the best I could but could not figure out what was causing this. I don't claim to be an expert on VB or VB objects like the PAINET object that was being used to send email. I looked on the web for clues and saw somebody saying that they switched to using the CDO object for sending email as it was better. I also remembered that I had done some VBS at Ameriquest and I had sent email from those scripts. When I looked at it I saw that I too was using the CDO object.</p>

<p>Next I tried replacing the usage of the PAINET object to send email with the CDO object and the send date problem seemed to have corrected itself.</p>

<p>Now it's not working in one very specific and unfortunately one very critical place - nbu-cqweb!</p>

<p>Another thing I could not figure out with the PAINET object is that it never seemed to specify an SMTP server to use to send the email. It just did it somehow. (Turns out it actually uses the client's settings and is exactly the reason why the user must set these!) The CDO object, however, needs to have an SMTP server specified so I used one I thought was guaranteed to be available - smtphost.broadcom.com. This works... while in Broadcom but it does not work when in the DMZ and nbu_cqweb is in the DMZ.</p>

<p>I see two options at this point:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Revert back to the old PAINET object and live with the send date of 2001 until we can figure out why that's happening (Considering that it's now known that it's the clients settings as to which SMTP server is used, it's quite possible that one user may generate email with a send date in the year 2001 while another user wouldn't) or</li>

  <li>Figure out an SMTP host in the DMZ and implement code to use it when in the DMZ or use smtphost.broadcom.com when not in the DMZ.</li>
</ol>

<p>For the second approach the problem is that I need to dynamically use mms.broadcom.com while in the DMZ and smtphost.broadcom.com when not in the DMZ. How does one tell? I thought I could simply check the hostname or domainname but I don't see any easy ways of getting this information in VB. Does anybody else?</p>

                              <h2>Mobile Multimedia Clearquest Design</h2>

<p>I've been working today coming up with a prototype/mock up of what Jean has proposed so far. Please remember this is a rough prototype and is
(very) subject to change. IOW things like state flow, requiredness of the fields, automatic and other action hooks and scripts are not in place. Also, after developing this for the Clearquest client I made it available on CQ Web so you can see it. Then I noticed that the alignment and fonts don't translate well to the web.</p>

<p>Feel free to play with this through the web and give me your initial impressions, but remember there's still a lot of work to be done - this is by no means polished.</p>

<p>To access it go to http://p4test/cqweb/login. Login as guest:guest and
then select the MM database.</p>
