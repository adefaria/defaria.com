  <li>Upgraded sons-sc-cc to be a registry server</li>

  <li>Removed old replicas in the SC region on sons-clearcase</li>

  <li>Rereplicated the vobs from sons-clearcase. Note sons-clearcase aborted a few times when doing this. I noticed some disk block errors in the Event Viewer. Good thing you have a new system with RAID!</li>

  <li>Cleaned up some more of lost+found</li>

  <li>Looked into the scripts to evaluate the impact of the server switch. There will be some changes but by and large they will be minimal.</li>

  <li>Both <a href="http://sons-sc-cc.salira.com/ccweb">Clearcase Web</a> and <a href="http://sons-sc-cc.salira.com/cqweb/login">Clearquest Web</a> are up and functional.</li>

                              <h3>lost+found</h3>

<p>The lost+found directory in vobs is there to catch elements that would have otherwise disappeared as a result of a Clearcase action. For example, you create a new directory and put a file in it. Then you decide you don't want that directory so your rmname it. Where does the file under it go? Answer: lost+found. This gives you a chance to recover it should you need to and know where to get it. But most often users either don't want to recover it or simply recreate it. This creates lost+found junk.</p>

                              <p>After speaking to Ron and getting the remote access working I did a few more things last night I:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Installed Clearcase. After Ron had changed the name of the machine to sons-sc-cc all was fine with the Clearcase installation. And multitool (Multisite's cleartool) is even there!</li>

  <li>Installed the Clearcase patch so you're totally up to date.</li>

  <li>Installed Clearquest</li>

  <li>Copied over \\sons-clearcase\Tools -> \\sons-sc-cc\Tools</li>

  <li>Installed and configured Cygwin. This took a while to get all the config stuff there, etc. Created a \\sons-sc-cc\Tools\Cygwin local package area. Sons-sc-cc has the latest Cygwin now.</li>

  <li>Created Clearcase stgloc's for Vobs and Views</li>

  <li>Created empty shell vobs for salira, salira2, tools and hardware. These will be where I Multisite to.</li>

  <li>Defragged drives on new machine.</li>

  <li>Made sure sons-sc-cc was up to date with WindowsUpdate.</li>
</ul>

<p>Tonight I intend to create the initial replica packets for the vobs then ship them over to sons-sc-cc and setup Multisite syncing. I will first Multisite a vob like Tools or perhaps hardware just to go through the procedure and get the syncing jobs set up. Then I will do both salira and salira2.</p>

<p>There's probably still loose ends that need to be looked at but my plan is basically to be able to build in salira (I don't know how to build in salira2!) using only sons-sc-cc.</p>

<p>At that point we could create some views there for say Simon and teach him how to switch regions to the new SC region. Then he'd be working with the new vob server. He could build and otherwise check it out.</p>
