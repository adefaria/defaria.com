<p><b>Time spend:</b> 7 hours</p>
                              
                              <h3>Cleaning up Multisite Packets</h3>

<p>First order of business was to attempt to clean up multisite packets that reside in the shipping bays for both sons-clearcase and sons-sc-cc as much as possible. As per my prior work there seems to be huge sync packets to sync, which takes time. I wanted to attempt a chmaster on an older branch to see how that changes from sons-clearcase -&gt; sons-sc.cc.  Part of the chmaster involves informing the other replica of the change. This happens through the normal multisite syncreplica. If the bays are full of huge packets then I need to process them first. One problem I hit was running out of space on sons-sc-cc. Normally this is not a problem as there is enough space on the C drive where the vobs reside. But with these huge packets going back and forth I was running out of space. Cleaned up some space and attempt to import all packets on sons-sc-cc. I also attempted to scrub the cleartext pool on sons-clearcase, which has grown to 4 gig! The cleartext pool is a caching mechanism thus since Clearcase can reconstruct the cleartext pool at any time (cleartext is mutable) I figured I could save 4 gig.</p>

<h3>Testing chmaster</h3>

<p>Tested out that I cannot check out, and back in, and element on the rel_1.0 branch from a view on sons-sc-cc. I then attempted to transfer mastership of the rel_1.0 branch -&gt;  sons-sc-cc but received the following error:<br>

<div class=code><pre>
<b>[ccadmin] sons-clearcase:</b><u>ct chmaster SantaClara brtype:rel_1.0@\\salira</u>
cleartool: Error: Branch type "rel_1.0" has branches (with default mastership) that have outstanding checkouts.
</pre></div>

<p>Actually there are still checkout on the rel_1.0 branch in, for example, the view YXiu_view_desktop (e.g. salira/neopon/build/makefile).</p>

<h3>Ran dbcheck on salira vob to fix corruption</h3>

<p><b>10:40 Pm:</b> Decided to give up on the testing of chmaster and get the vob fixed. Locked salira vob. Started copy of db</p>

<p>Hmmm... Doesn't seem like the key file rebuild was really completed. I wonder... Should I try again? Trying again...</p>

<p>Third times a charm they say! keybuild ran to completion but for a while it was touch and go as sons-clearcase was not responding. Now, however, I can import the packets that were stuck... Well most of them:</p>

<p>Damn. Ran syncreplica -import again and everything got processed. I'm glad it's processed but I can't help but wonder why I hit these errors...</p>

<p>Hello Andrew,</p>

<p>For the error: 06/23/06 07:48:04 db_server(10104): Error: db_server.exe(10104): Error: Database identifier 427883 not foundin "../db__obj.c" line 731.</p>

<p>This could possibly mean there is an issue with the VOBs database. Unfortunately I cannot determine which VOB this is for? I would need you to run a "dbcheck" on the VOB that is reporting this error. Unfortunately I was seeing this error many times in the logs so I cannot tell for which VOB it is reporting this on.</p>

<p>(10104) in the error is the process id that is/was running. This may help in finding the VOB. </p>

<p>I'm pretty sure I know the vob in question - their main vob (\salira).</p>

<p>I tried following that by using the method of lock vob, copy the vob database files, unlock vob, dbcheck the copy. Everytime I got a -4 error so I went back to do lock vob, dbcheck, unlock vob.</p>

<p>I was surprised to see some stuff come out on stderr:</p>

<p>Depending on the dbcheck output, we may need to get a copy of the VOB's db directory but I rather hold off on that request until we see what the dbcheck reports.<p>

<p>I"ve attached the dbcheck output.</p>
