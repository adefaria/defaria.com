                              <h2>Integrating LDAP to enable_ldap</h2>

<p>I decided it would be good if as enable_ldap gathers parameters, it checks to see if they are correct. It does this by actually calling LDAP calls to validate the things like the server, port, etc. The goal is to make enable_ldap insure that the parameters are indeed correct. Unfortunately this makes enable_ldap dependent on the Net::LDAP module but I think it's worth it to allow enable_ldap to check the parameters and the mapping the user is describing.</p>

<p>I still need to tighten up the code where it queries LDAP and attempts to prove to the user that the mapping is correct. As I understand it you are basically attempting to map a Clearquest field to an LDAP field so that Clearquest can find the correct record. Once that linkage is established Clearquest can "pull" the password from LDAP and thus authenticate the user's password to the LDAP password.</p>

<p>What enable_ldap does is effectively this, however, it's not that informative to simply say "The user ID 'foo' was found in the LDAP directory" rather I want to say "The user id 'foo' corresponds with '&lt;fullname&gt;'". However does "fullname" always appear exactly as that in LDAP?</p>

<p>Additionally, I need to handle the cases where it's not a match or where say multiple entries are returned (not sure how that can happen unless the user specifies an attribute that can have dups or perhaps enters in a wildcard, e.g. "defaria*").</p>

<p>OK, here's what I found out so far. Using adefaria as a test machine I first checked to see what FlexLM license server was being used on that machine by selecting <b>Start: All Programs: Rational Software: Rational License Key Administrator</b>. It was using just sons-clearcase. Next I attempting to talk to Clearquest by both the Clearquest GUI and cqc.  Then I stopped the FlexLM service on sons-clearcase. I then started the Clearquest GUI and it complained about no license server. Interestingly cqc continued to work. This may be because cqc/cqd opens the Clearquest database in a read only mode.</p>

<p>Next I added sons-sc-cc as a FlexLM License server and retested. Both the Clearcase GUI and cqc were able to obtain a license from sons-sc-cc with no problems. I even shutdown Clearcase on sons-clearcase and I was still able to use Clearcase GUI and cqc from adefaria with no problems.</p>

<p>I then restarted both FlexLM and Clearcase on sons-clearcase.</p>

<p>Dylan, perhaps you want to test this on your workstation. Try adding sons-sc-cc as a FlexLM license server for your desktop. You can toggle off sons-clearcase as a license server and attempt to access Clearquest. You can then stop the FlexLM service on sons-clearcase and test Clearquest access from your machine again. Finally try shutting down Clearcase on sons-clearcase and retest Clearquest access from your machine.</p>

<h3>Adding a FlexLM License Server to your Desktop</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Select <b>Start: All Programs: Rational Software: Rational
License Key Administrator</b>:<br>
    <br>
    <img src="/blogs/Status/images/RLKA_sons-clearcase.jpg" alt=""></li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Select <b>License Keys: License Key Wizard<br>
    <br>
    </b><img src="/blogs/Status/images/LKA_Wizard.jpg" alt=""><br>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Select <b>Next<br>
    </b><br>
    <img src="/blogs/Status/images/Server_Name_and_Port.jpg" alt=""><br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Select <b>Advanced Server Options:<br>
    <br>
    </b><img src="/blogs/Status/images/Client_Server_Configuration.jpg" alt=""><br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Select <b>Add Server:<br>
    </b><br>
    <img src="/blogs/Status/images/Client_Server_Configuration2.jpg" alt=""><br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Click on <b>Values</b> under the <b>Settings</b> on the right
on the <font color="#ff0000">Server Name</font> column type sons-sc-cc
and <b>Enter</b>. The server name should change from "New Server"
-&gt; "sons-sc-cc":<br>
    <br>
    <img src="/blogs/Status/images/Client_Server_Configuration3.jpg" alt=""><br>
    <br>
At this point you can toggle on or off either sons-clearcase or
sons-sc-cc as a license server provider.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Select <b>OK</b> to close this dialog box. You should see
something like:<br>
    <br>
    <img src="/blogs/Status/images/RLKA_both.jpg" alt=""><br>
    <br>
Note that there are 3 lines, two serviced by sons-clearcase (Rational
ClearCase LT and Rational ClearQuest) and one serviced by sons-sc-cc
(Rational ClearQuest). Also note that if you stop FlexLM on
sons-clearcase and refresh or return the Rational Key License
Administrator then licenses served by sons-clearcase will not be listed
(since the server cannot be contacted.<br>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Similarly, all desktops (or Clearquest GUI clients) will have to adjust
their FlexLM License Key Server in a similar manner. Also note that you
can, instead of adding a server, simply click on the sons-clearcase
server then click on <b>Values</b> under the <b>Settings</b> on the
right on the <font color="#ff0000">Server Name</font> column and
replace sons-clearcase with sons-sc-cc.</p>

<p>If the test is successful then I believe that sons-clearcase can be powered off. Again, I think we should still run about a week this way and if things are OK then I can rmreplica the US replicas leaving only the China (sons-cc) ones and the SantaClara (sons-sc-cc) ones.</p>

                              <h2>Silent Install and Multiple License Servers</h2>

<p>I had hoped to be able to user the /g parm to setup.exe so that the install would be silent and automatic. Clearquest now installs without need for a reboot. But silent install installs silently but then reboots! Ugh!</p>

<p>Also wanted to be able to specify multiple license servers as TI uses 3 of them. I hoped that merely updating sitedefs.dat to list three of them, comma separated would work. But it doesn't. Perhaps spaces? Also need to check siteprep to see if the area can be reprepped with 3 license servers</p>
