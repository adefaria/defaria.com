<p>along with an attachment of medicare.vvv. So, being a good, conscientious citizen I figured I'd report the incident in order to help others down the road. I asked around and was told that I need submit a help desk ticket and that I need to first contact the help desk to do so. Funny, I'd thought this would just be a "forward the email to &lt;x&gt;" and I'd be done with it. So I'm directed to a web page which has the number for the help desk. I call that number (it's 9:40 Am mind you) and I get voice mail saying "I'm sorry but nobody's here to take your call" and to leave a message. So, wanting to dispose of this issue rather than have it remain, I decided to go back to the web site and see if there was an answer to the question. I searched for "report phishing attempts" and "report spam" and there was nothing found! Oh well I tried but does this frustrate anybody else as much as it does me?</p>

<p>Oh and if click on the Contact Us link you'll start and email that will be returned to you undeliverable!</p>
