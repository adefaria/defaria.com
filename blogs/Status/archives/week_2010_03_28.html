                              <p>Dang IDEs! They're often more trouble than they are worth!! Be wary!</p>

<p>I'm in Eclipse and I was trying to clean up my view a little bit. I selected a few view private files I wanted to delete with Control-Click. Then I hit the delete key to delete them. Eclipse prompted me "Are you sure you want to delete these files?" and I responded yes. But then I noticed that one of the files that was selected was mktriggers.pl!!! I did not select mktriggers.pl explicitly - it was selected because that was the last file I was editing was mktriggers.pl. And, remember, I only expected this delete to be deleting the view private files I selected, not Clearcase elements. I did not expect any rmnames to be happening.</p>

<p>No worries you say? This is in Clearcase you say? Yes it was. But it was also checked out and with my most recent modifications. "Ah", I hear you saying, "Clearcase shouldn't be doing any explicit destructive activities without asking you first" - well it just did! It rmnamed mktriggers.pl without confirmation. Sure it asked whether or not I wanted to remove files, and I did, the ones I explicitly selected - not the one it had selected simply because I was editing a file. "Well shouldn't there be an option on rmname that you have to specify in order for rmname to proceed?" Yes there is - it's -force and good old Eclipse must have called rmname with -force!</p>

<p>"But surely there's a .keep file around or something that you can recover from". Well ah, no. Not in this case. My work has been lost!</p>

<p>You have been warned!</p>
