  <h2>About me</h2>
  <p>Hello, my name is Andrew DeFaria. Welcome to my little corner of
  the internet.</p>

  <p>Well I'm still in California. After having travelled to Dallas, Phoenix,
  Seattle, Reston and after reminding myself how much I didn't like the East
  coast I'm back in good ole San Jose, California! Enjoying the climate,
  mountains and wine. But San Jose didn't last and I finally made it down to
  beautiful San Diego! And I'm loving it! I'm 2 miles from the beach, which
  is great, there's plenty of interesting hiking, lovely weather and a great
  new contract.</p>

  <p>Before that I moved across the country to Reston, VA to take up a
  contract with Fannie Mae. Alas, after a few weeks the contract
  lost its funding.</p>

  <p>Prior to that it was off to the <i>Great White North</i> I
  guess - really the Pacific Northwest. I've taken a contract in
  Seattle and am moving up there for 2010. New year - new place.</p>

  <p>I also managed to upgrade my car to a brand new <a
  href="/gallery/index.php/Corvette/Vette_at_Lost_Dog_Trail.jpg">2008
  Chevy Corvette</a>! That's all the pictures I have of it so far as I
  lost my good camera and only have my cell phone camera. The car is
  wonderful with lots of power and creature comforts.</p>

  <p>Last year I was working at Texas Instruments and moved from
  California, where I lived for some 20 years, back to Dallas. It was
  a lot cheaper to live there. I've had some <a
  href="/blogs/Personal/archives/000614.html">health issues</a> of
  late but am doing much better now.</p>

  <p>Before moving to Dallas I was working at <a
  href="http://www.hp.com/go/ilm">HP Information Lifecycle Management
  Solutions</a> up in Pleasanton.</p>

  <h2>Music</h2>

  <p>And as the picture shows I'm a guitarist. Click on
  the picture to see a photo album of my previous bands or see <a
  href="/Band">Band</a> for more detail. <span class="standout">News
  flash!</span> The cast of <a href="/Band"><i>Cast of
  Shadows</i></a> are working on new stuff. More on that when it
  arrives!</p>

  <h2>Photos</h2>

  <p>Of course one must have their <a href="/gallery">Photos</a>
  online for those who want to take a peek at you and your
  family. Pictures do help to get a better sense of another person. I
  have a whole bunch of photos arranged into albums using <a
  href="http://gallery.menalto.com">Gallery</a>
  which is an open source <a href="http://php.net">PHP</a> package for
  managing photos into albums on a web site.</p>

  <p>Then there is the <a href="/Family">Family</a> section which is
  basically about my daughter Danielle.</p>

  <h2>Car</h2>

  <p>At some point I need to fix up the section about my <a
  href="/Vette">Corvette</a>. Actually most of it is about my first
  vette and very little about my second one. Alas they are both gone
  now!</p>

  <p>But true to the phoenix name, from the ashes arises a new <a
  href="/gallery/main.php?g2_view=core.ShowItem&g2_itemId=6564">Corvette</a>!
  Alas it only highlight the need to further update the Corvette
  section...</p>

  <h2>Quicken 2000</h2>

  <p>I used to run the <a href="/Quicken">Unofficial Quicken Web
  Page</a> but haven't been updating that since around 2000. There is
  still some good information in there though.</p>

  <h2>MAPS - My own Spam filter</h2>

  <p><a href="/maps">MAPS</a>, or <i>Mail Authorization and Permission
  System</i>, is my email filtering system. I get a <b>lot</b> of email -
  typically about 5000 emails a week! - and only about 1% of it is
  email that I want. Being bombarded by spam like that makes one
  protect themselves. MAPS will eventually be available for anybody to
  use but is currently still in development. Stay tuned...</p>

  <h2>Jokes</h2>

  <p><a href="/Jokes">Jokes</a> is just a section where I can put
  together various lists of jokes and funnies that I've found over the
  years.</p>

  <h2>Blogging</h2>

  <p>Also, I'm into web logging and learning <span
  class="standout">Cascading Style Sheets</span> so check out my <a
  href="/blogs">Weblogs</a>...</p>
