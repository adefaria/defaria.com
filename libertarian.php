    Joseph Sobran</li>

    <li>Remember, democracy never lasts long. It soon wastes,
    exhausts, and murders itself. There never was a democracy yet
    that did not commit suicide. - John Adams (1814)</li>

    temporary safety, deserve neither liberty nor safety. -
    Benjamin Franklin</li>

    the evils in this world are to be cured by

    <li>The more corrupt the state, the more it
    legislates. - Tacitus</li>

    master. - George Washington</li>

    legislature is in session. - Mark Twain (1866)</li>

    <li>There is no worse tyranny than to force a man to pay for
    what he does not want merely because you think it would be good
    for him. - Robert Heinlein</li>

    <li>The true danger is when Liberty is nibbled away, for
    expedients. - Edmund Burke (1899)</li>

    <li>Peace, commerce and honest friendship with all nations;
    entangling alliances with none. - Thomas Jefferson</li>

    <li>The triumph of persuasion over force is the sign of a
    civilized society. - Mark Skousen</li>

    <li>A wise and frugal government which shall restrain men from
    injuring one another, which shall leave them otherwise free to
    regulate their own pursuits of industry and improvement, and
    shall not take from the mouth of labor the bread it has
    earned. This is the sum of good government. - Thomas
    Jefferson (1801)</li>

    <li>The evils of tyranny are rarely seen but by him who resists
    it. - John Hay (1872)</li>

    <li>Democracy must be something more than two wolves and a sheep
    voting on what to have for dinner. - James Bovard
    (1994)</li>

    <li>The natural progress of things is for liberty to yield and
    government to gain ground. - Thomas Jefferson</li>

    <li>Timid men prefer the calm of despotism to the tempestuous
    sea of Liberty. - Thomas Jefferson</li>

    <li>None are more hopelessly enslaved than those who falsely

    <li>The urge to save humanity is almost always a false front for
    the urge to rule. - H.L. Mencken</li>

    <li>It is not the business of government to make men virtuous or
    religious, or to preserve the fool from the consequences of his
    own folly. Government should be repressive no further than is
    necessary to secure liberty by protecting the equal rights of
    each from aggression on the part of others, and the moment
    governmental prohibitions extend beyond this line they are in
    danger of defeating the very ends they are intended to
    serve. - Henry George</li>

    <li>Where morality is present, laws are unnecessary. Without
    morality, laws are unenforceable. - Anonymous</li>

    in the pursuit of justice is no virtue. - Barry
    Goldwater (1964)</li>

    <li>Liberty is not a means to a political end. It is itself the
    highest political end. - Lord Acton</li>

    <li>The power to tax is the power to destroy. - John
    Marshall</li>

    <li>[On ancient Athens]: In the end, more than freedom, they
    wanted security. They wanted a comfortable life, and they lost
    it all - security, comfort, and freedom. When the
    Athenians finally wanted not to give to society but for society
    to give to them, when the freedom they wished for most was
    freedom from responsibility, then Athens ceased to be free and
    was never free again. - Edward Gibbon</li>

    <li>Of all tyrannies, a tyranny exercised for the good of its
    victims may be the most oppressive. It may be better to live
    under robber barons than under omnipotent moral busybodies. The
    robber baron's cruelty may sometimes sleep, his cupidity may at
    some point be satiated; but those who torment us for our own
    good will torment us without end, for they do so with the
    approval of their own conscience. - C. S. Lewis</li>

    <li>Vices are simply the errors which a man makes in his search
    after his own happiness. Unlike crimes, they imply no malice
    toward others, and no interference with their persons or
    property. - Lysander Spooner</li>

    <li>In order to get power and retain it, it is necessary to love
    power; but love of power is not connected with goodness but with
    qualities that are the opposite of goodness, such as pride,
    cunning, and cruelty. - Leo Tolstoy</li>

    <li>There's no way to rule innocent men. The only power any
    government has is the power to crack down on criminals. Well,
    when there aren't enough criminals, one makes them. One declares
    so many things to be a crime that it becomes impossible to live
    without breaking laws. - Ayn Rand</li>

    <li>If ye love wealth greater than liberty, the tranquility of
    servitude greater than the animating contest for freedom, go
    home from us in peace. We seek not your counsel, nor your
    arms. Crouch down and lick the hand that feeds you. May your
    chains set lightly upon you; and may posterity forget that ye
    were our countrymen. - Samuel Adams</li>

    <li>If a nation values anything more than freedom, it will lose
    its freedom; and the irony of it is that if it is comfort or
    money that it values more, it will lose that, too. -
    Somerset Maugham</li>

    <li>A democracy cannot exist as a permanent form of
    government. It can only exist until a majority of voters
    discover that they can vote themselves largess out of the public
    treasury. - Alexander Tytler</li>

    <li>A liberal is someone who feels a great debt to his fellow
    man, which debt he proposes to pay off with your
    money. - G. Gordon Liddy</li>

    <li>The United States is a nation of laws, badly written and
    randomly enforced. - Frank Zappa</li>

    <li>Liberty lies in the hearts of men and women. When it dies
    there, no constitution, no law, no court can save it. -
    Justice Learned Hand</li>

    <li>It is sobering to reflect that one of the best ways to get
    yourself a reputation as a dangerous citizen these days is to go
    about repeating the very phrases which our founding fathers used
    in the struggle for independence. - Charles
    A. Beard</li>

    <li>A nation of sheep will beget a government of
    wolves. - Edward R. Murrow</li>

    <li>The legitimate powers of government extend to such acts only
    as are injurious to others. But it does me no injury for my
    neighbor to say there are twenty gods, or no god. It neither
    picks my pocket nor breaks my leg. - Thomas Jefferson
    (1781)</li>

    <li>The desire to rule is the mother of heresies. -
    St. John Chrysostom</li>

    <li>Can our form of government, our system of justice, survive
    if one can be denied a freedom because he might abuse it?
    - Harlon Carter</li>

    <li>It is not the responsibility of the government or the legal
    system to protect a citizen from himself. - Justice
    Casey Percell</li>

    <li>No one can read our Constitution without concluding that the
    people who wrote it wanted their government severely limited;
    the words "no" and "not" employed in restraint of government
    power occur 24 times in the first seven articles of the
    Constitution and 22 more times in the Bill of Rights. -
    Edmund A. Opitz</li>

    <li>The government was set to protect man from criminals
    - and the Constitution was written to protect man from
    the government. - Ayn Rand</li>

    <li>The only difference between a tax man and a taxidermist is
    that the taxidermist leaves the skin. - Mark Twain</li>

    <li>What this country needs are more unemployed
    politicians. - Edward Langley</li>

    <li>I believe that every individual is naturally entitled to do
    as he pleases with himself and the fruits of his labor, so far
    as it in no way interferes with any other men's
    rights. - Abraham Lincoln</li>

    <li>Those who expect to reap the benefits of freedom, must, like
    men, undergo the fatigue of supporting it. - Thomas
    Paine</li>

    <li>Liberty is always dangerous, but it is the safest thing we
    have. - Harry Emerson Fosdick</li>

    <li>The state in which the rulers are the most reluctant to
    govern is always the best and most quietly governed; and the
    state in which they are the most eager, the worst. -
    Anonymous</li>

    <li>It is much more important to kill bad bills than to pass
    good ones. - Calvin Coolidge</li>

    <li>To compel a man to furnish contributions of money for the
    propagation of opinions which he disbelieves and abhors, is
    sinful and tyrannical. - Thomas Jefferson</li>

    <li>It is dangerous to be right when the government is
    wrong. - Voltaire</li>

    <li>The war for freedom will never really be won because the
    price of our freedom is constant vigilance over ourselves and
    over our Government. - Eleanor Roosevelt</li>

    <li>Blessed are the young, for they shall inherit the national
    debt. - Herbert Hoover</li>

    <li>Give me liberty or give me death! - Patrick
    Henry</li>

    <li>First they came for the Jews, but I did nothing because I'm
    not a Jew. Then they came for the socialists, but I did nothing
    because I'm not a socialist. Then they came for the Catholics,
    but I did nothing because I'm not a Catholic. Finally, they came
    for me, but by then there was no one left to help me. -
    Pastor Father Niemoller (1946)</li>

    <li>Government at its best is a necessary evil, and at its
    worst, an intolerant one. - Thomas Paine</li>

    <li>There's never been a good government. - Emma
    Goldman</li>

    <li>We must have government, but we must watch them like a
    hawk. - Millicent Fenwick (1983)</li>

    <li>A little government and a little luck are necessary in life,
    but only a fool trusts either of them. -
    P. J. O'Rourke</li>

    <li>Government never furthered any enterprise but by the
    alacrity with which it got out of its way. - Henry David
    Thoreau</li>

    <li>Reader, suppose you were an idiot. And suppose you were a
    member of Congress. But I repeat myself. - Mark
    Twain</li>

    <li>There is no distinctly native American criminal class save
    Congress. - Mark Twain</li>

    <li>Talk is cheap - except when Congress does
    it. - Cullen Hightower</li>

    <li>You cannot adopt politics as a profession and remain
    honest. - Ambrose Gwinett Bierce</li>

    <li>[Political] offices are as acceptable here as elsewhere, and
    whenever a man cast a longing eye on them, a rottenness begins
    in his conduct. - Thomas Jefferson (1799)</li>

    <li>The single most exciting thing you encounter in government
    is competence, because it's so rare. - Daniel Patrick
    Moynihan (1976)</li>

    <li>The most fundamental purpose of government is defense, not
    empire. - Joseph Sobran (1995)</li>

    they can spend more. - Allan H. Meltzer (1993)</li>

    are decided by somebody else, it makes no difference to the
    individual whether that somebody else is a king, a dictator, or
    society at large. - James Taggart (1992)</li>

    <li>No drug, not even alcohol, causes the fundamental ills of
    society. If we're looking for the sources of our troubles, we
    shouldn't test people for drugs, we should test them for
    stupidity, ignorance, greed, and love of power. -
    P. J. O'Rourke (1992)</li>

    <li>Here's your enemy for this week, the government says. And
    some gullible Americans click their heels and salute -
    often without knowing who or even where the enemy of the week
    is. - Charley Reese (1998)</li>

    <li>The great virtue of a free market system is that it does not
    care what color people are; it does not care what their religion
    is; it only cares whether they can produce something you want to
    buy. It is the most effective system we have discovered to
    enable people who hate one another to deal with one another and
    help one another. - Milton Friedman</li>

    <li>The best government is the one that charges you the least
    blackmail for leaving you alone. - Thomas Rudmose-Brown

    see what it costs when it's free. - P.J. O'Rourke

    happy appetite at one end and no responsibility at the
    other. - Ronald Reagan</li>

    <li>Americans have the right and advantage of being armed
    - unlike the citizens of other countries whose
    governments are afraid to trust the people with arms. -
    James Madison</li>

    <li>The whole of the Bill [of Rights] is a declaration of the
    right of the people at large or considered as individuals - It
    establishes some rights of the individual as unalienable and
    which consequently, no majority has a right to deprive them
    of. - Albert Gallatin (1789)</li>

    <li>The Constitution shall never be construed - to prevent the
    people of the United States who are peaceable citizens from
    keeping their own arms. - Samuel Adams</li>

    the time in which we live I am ready to worship it. -

    against every form of tyranny over the mind of man. -

    people. - George Washington</li>

    <li>A sword never kills anybody; it is a tool in the killer's
    hand. - Lucius Annaeus Seneca, c. 4BC - 65AD.</li>

    <li>He that hath no sword, let him sell his garment and buy
    one. - the Bible, Luke 22:36.</li>

    arms, as the blackest. - Mahatma Gandhi, in Gandhi, An
    Autobiography, p. 446</li>

    there is found state education. It has been discovered that the
    best way to ensure implicit obedience is to commence tyranny in
    the nursery. - Benjamin Disraeli, 1874</li>

    <li>These rights and freedoms may in no case be exercised
    contrary to the purposes and principles of the United
    Nations. - UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights,
    Article 29(3).</li>

    it. And if it stops moving, subsidize it. - Ronald

    socialism by its hopes and aspirations; capitalism by its works
    and socialism by its literature. - Sidney Hook</li>

    <li>War is the health of the State. - Randolph Bourne
    (1917)</li>

    <li>Foreign aid might be defined as a transfer from poor people
    in rich countries to rich people in poor countries. -
    Douglas Casey (1992)</li>

    <li>If you want government to intervene domestically, you're a
    liberal. If you want government to intervene overseas, you're a
    conservative. If you want government to intervene everywhere,
    you're a moderate. If you don't want government to intervene
    anywhere, you're an extremist. - Joseph Sobran
    (1995)</li>

    money as possible from one party of the citizens to give to the
    other. - Voltaire (1764)</li>

    big enough to take it all away. - Barry Goldwater

    the facts. - Will Rogers</li>

    <li>Nothing is so permanent as a temporary government
    program. - Milton Friedman</li>

    <li>The whole aim of practical politics is to keep the populace
    alarmed - and hence clamorous to be led to safety
    - by menacing it with an endless series of hobgoblins,
    all of them imaginary. - H.L. Mencken</li>

    <li>There are just two rules of governance in a free society:
    Mind your own business. Keep your hands to yourself. -
    P.J. O'Rourke (1993)</li>

    <li>The human race divides politically into those who want
    people to be controlled and those who have no such
    desire. - Robert A. Heinlein</li>

    <li>Just because you do not take an interest in politics doesn't
    mean politics won't take an interest in you. - Pericles
    (430 BC)</li>

    <li>There is no virtue in compulsory government charity, and
    there is no virtue in advocating it. A politician who portrays
    himself as "caring" and "sensitive" because he wants to expand
    the government's charitable programs is merely saying that he's
    willing to try to do good with other people's money. Well, who
    isn't? And a voter who takes pride in supporting such programs
    is telling us that he'll do good with his own money - if
    a gun is held to his head. - P.J. O'Rourke</li>

    folly is to fill the world with fools. - Herbert Spencer

    bear arms is, as a last resort, to protect themselves against
    tyranny in government. - Thomas Jefferson</li>

    <li>Liberty is the only thing you cannot have unless you are
    willing to give it to others. - William Allen White</li>

    <li>I have ever deemed it fundamental for the United States
    never to take active part in the quarrels of Europe. Their
    political interests are entirely distinct from ours. Their
    mutual jealousies, their balance of power, their complicated
    alliances, their forms and principles of government, are all
    foreign to us. They are nations of eternal war. - Thomas
    Jefferson (1823)</li>

    <li>America does not go abroad in search of monsters to
    destroy. She is the well-wisher to the freedom and independence
    of all. She well knows that by enlisting under other banners
    than her own, were they even the banners of foreign
    independence, she would involve herself beyond the power of
    extrication in all the wars of interest and intrigue, of
    individual avarice, envy and ambition, which assume the colors
    and usurp the standards of freedom. - John Quincy Adams
    (1821)</li>

    <li>An Avidity to punish is always dangerous to liberty. It
    leads men to stretch, to misinterpret, and to misapply even the
    best of laws. He that would make his own liberty secure must
    guard even his enemy from oppression; for if he violates this
    duty he a establishes a precedent that will reach to
    himself. - Thomas Paine (1795)</li>

    <li>Government is the great fiction, through which everybody
    endeavors to live at the expense of everybody else. -
    Frederic Bastiat</li>

    <li>Ask not what you can do for your country; ask what your
    government is doing to you. - Joseph Sobran (1990)</li>

    <li>God grants liberty only to those who love it, and are always
    ready to guard and defend it. - Daniel Webster
    (1834)</li>

    <li>The saddest epitaph which can be carved in memory of a
    vanished liberty is that it was lost because its possessors
    failed to stretch forth a saving hand while yet there was
    time. - Justice George Sutherland (1938)</li>

    <li>The era of resisting big government is never over. -
    Paul Gigot (1998)</li>

    <li>Not a place upon earth might be so happy as America. Her
    situation is remote from all the wrangling world, and she has
    nothing to do but to trade with them. - Thomas Paine
    (1776)</li>

    <li>Bureaucracy is a giant mechanism operated by
    pygmies. - Honore de Balzac</li>

    <li>Whoever prefers life to death, happiness to suffering,
    well-being to misery must defend without compromise private
    ownership in the means of production. - Ludwig von Mises
    (1920)</li>

    <li>If angels were to govern men, neither external nor internal
    controls on government would be necessary. In framing a
    government that is to be administered by men over men, the great
    difficulty lies in this: you must first enable the government to
    control the governed; and in the next place oblige it to control
    itself. - James Madison</li>

    <li>Let the people think they govern and they will be
    governed. - William Penn (1693)</li>

    <li>In 1940, teachers were asked what they regarded as the three
    major problems in American schools. They identified the three
    major problems as: Littering, noise, and chewing gum. Teachers
    last year were asked what the three major problems in American
    schools were, and they defined them as: Rape, assault, and
    suicide. - William Bennett (1993)</li>

    <li>The threat posed by humans to the natural environment is
    nothing compared to the threat to humans posed by global
    environmental policy. - Fred L. Smith (1992)</li>

    <li>The spirit of truth and the spirit of freedom - they
    are the pillars of society. - Henrik Ibsen (1877)</li>

    <li>Government is actually the worst failure of civilized
    man. There has never been a really good one, and even those that
    are most tolerable are arbitrary, cruel, grasping, and
    unintelligent. - H. L. Mencken</li>

    <li>Sometimes it is said that man cannot be trusted with the
    government of himself. Can he, then, be trusted with the
    government of others? - Thomas Jefferson (1801)</li>

    <li>This country is a one-party country. Half of it is called
    Republican and half is called Democrat. It doesn't make any
    difference. All the really good ideas belong to the
    Libertarians. - Hugh Downs (1997)</li>

    <li>Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts
    absolutely. - Lord Acton (1887)</li>

    <li>Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun. -
    Mao Zedong (1938)</li>

    <li>The difference between libertarianism and socialism is that
    libertarians will tolerate the existence of a socialist
    community, but socialists can't tolerate a libertarian
    community. - David D. Boaz (1997)</li>

    <li>We contend that for a nation to try to tax itself into
    prosperity is like a man standing in a bucket and trying to lift
    himself up by the handle. - Winston Churchill
    (1903)</li>

    <li>If you have been voting for politicians who promise to give
    you goodies at someone else's expense, then you have no right to
    complain when they take your money and give it to someone else,
    including themselves. - Thomas Sowell (1992)</li>

    <li>War has all the characteristics of socialism most
    conservatives hate: Centralized power, state planning, false
    rationalism, restricted liberties, foolish optimism about
    intended results, and blindness to unintended secondary
    results. - Joseph Sobran (1991)</li>

    <li>There never was a good war or a bad peace. -
    Benjamin Franklin (1773)</li>

    <li>Good intentions will always be pleaded for every assumption
    of authority. It is hardly too strong to say that the
    Constitution was made to guard the people against the dangers of
    good intentions. There are men in all ages who mean to govern
    well, but they mean to govern. They promise to be good masters,
    but they mean to be masters. - Daniel Webster
    (1782-1852)</li>

    <li>Everything that is really great and inspiring is created by
    the individual who can labor in freedom. - Albert
    Einstein</li>

    <li>Liberty means responsibility. That is why most men dread
    it. - George Bernard Shaw</li>

    <li>In matters of Power, let no more be heard of confidence in
    men, but bind him down from mischief by the chains of the
    Constitution. - Thomas Jefferson</li>

    <li>The Constitution is not an instrument for the government to
    restrain the people, it is an instrument for the people to
    restrain the government - lest it come to dominate our
    lives and interests. - Patrick Henry</li>

    <li>The strength of the Constitution, lies in the will of the
    people to defend it. - Thomas Edison</li>

    <li>The Constitution is a written instrument. As such, its
    meaning does not alter. That which it meant when it was adopted,
    it means now. - South Carolina v. United States, 199
    U.S. 437, 448 (1905)</li>

    <li>It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer,
    or the baker, that we expect our dinner, but from regard to
    their own interest. We address ourselves, not to their humanity
    but to their self-love, and never talk to them of our own
    necessities but of their advantages. Nobody but a beggar chooses
    to depend chiefly upon the benevolence of his fellow
    citizens. - Adam Smith, "The Wealth of Nations"</li>

    <li>Democracy is a pathetic belief in the collective wisdom of
    individual ignorance. - H.L. Mencken</li>

    <li>Collectivism doesn't work because it's based on a faulty
    economic premise. There is no such thing as a person's "fair
    share" of wealth. The gross national product is not a pizza that
    must be carefully divided because if I get too many slices, you
    have to eat the box. The economy is expandable and, in any
    practical sense, limitless. - P. J. O'Rourke, "How to
    Explain Conservatism"</li>

    <li>Government cannot make man richer, but it can make him
    poorer. - Ludwig von Mises</li>

    <li>The national budget must be balanced. The public debt must
    be reduced; the arrogance of the authorities must be moderated
    and controlled. Payments to foreign governments must be
    reduced. If the nation doesn't want to go bankrupt, people must
    again learn to work, instead of living on public
    assistance. - Marcus Tullius Cicero, 55 BC</li>

    <li>Liberals want the government to be your Mommy. Conservatives
    want government to be your Daddy. Libertarians want it to treat
    you like an adult. - Andre Marrou</li>

    <li>If a man does not keep pace with his companions, perhaps it
    is because he hears a different drummer. Let him step to the
    music which he hears, however measured or far away. -
    Henry David Thoreau, Walden (1854)</li>

    <li>Liberty consists in doing what one desires. - John
    Stuart Mill, On Liberty (1859)</li>

    <li>The only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised
    over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is
    to prevent harm to others. His own good, either physical or
    moral, is not sufficient warrant. - John Stuart Mill, On
    Liberty (1859)</li>

    <li>Left-wing politicians take away your liberty in the name of
    children and of fighting poverty, while right-wing politicians
    do it in the name of family values and fighting drugs. Either
    way, government gets bigger and you become less free. -
    Harry Browne</li>

    <li>If we don't believe in freedom of expression for people we
    despise, we don't believe in it at all. - Noam
    Chomsky</li>

    <li>I wanted to change the world. But I have found that the only
    thing one can be sure of changing is oneself. - Aldous
    Huxley</li>

    <li>The care of every man's soul belongs to himself. But what if
    he neglect the care of it? Well what if he neglect the care of
    his health or his estate, which would more nearly relate to the
    state. Will the magistrate make a law that he not be poor or
    sick? Laws provide against injury from others; but not from
    ourselves. God himself will not save men against their
    wills. - Thomas Jefferson</li>

    <li>America's abundance was not created by public sacrifices to
    the common good, but by the productive genius of free men who
    pursued their own personal interests and the making of their own
    private fortunes. - Ayn Rand</li>

    <li>There's always someone telling you not to do something. The
    main thing is just to ignore them. - Tim Robbins</li>

    <li>Everyone thinks about changing the world, but no one thinks
    about changing himself. - Leo Tolstoy</li>

    <li>One of the penalties for refusing to participate in politics
    is that you end up being governed by your inferiors. -
    Plato</li>

    <li>Every individual necessarily labors to render the annual
    revenue of society as great as he can. He generally neither
    intends to promote the public interest, nor knows how much he is
    promoting it. He intends only his own gain, and he is, in this,
    as in many other cases, led by an invisible hand to promote an
    end which was not part of his intention. - Adam Smith,
    Wealth of Nations</li>

    <li>The conclusion is thus inescapable that the history,
    concept, and wording of the Second Amendment to the Constitution
    of the United States, as well as its interpretation by every
    major commentator and court in the first half-century after its
    ratification, indicates that what is protected is an individual
    right of a private citizen to own and carry firearms in a
    peaceful manner. - Report of the Subcommittee on the
    Constitution of the Committee on the Judiciary, United States
    Senate, 97th Congress, Second Session (February 1982)</li>

    <li>When you subsidize poverty and failure, you get more of
    both. - James Dale Davidson, National Taxpayers
    Union</li>

    <li>If we have to kill 12 people to save 1 human life it will
    have been worth it. - Unknown</li>

    <li>Virtually all reasonable laws are obeyed, not because they
    are the law, but because reasonable people would do that
    anyway. If you obey a law simply because it is the law, that's a
    pretty likely sign that it shouldn't be a law. -
    Unknown</li>

    <li>The U.S. Constitution may be flawed, but it's a whole lot
    better than what we have now. - Unknown</li>

    <li>The welfare state reduces a citizen to a client,
    subordinates them to a bureaucrat, and subjects them to rules
    that are anti-work, anti-family, anti-opportunity and
    anti-property - Humans forced to suffer under such anti-human
    rules naturally develop pathologies. The evening news is the
    natural result of the welfare state. - Unknown</li>

    <li>I do not believe that the government should have its long
    nose poked into the private consensual relationships between
    people. - John Anderson, Independent presidential
    candidate, 1980</li>

    <li>When goods don't cross borders, soldiers will. -
    Fredric Bastiat, early French economist</li>

    <li>Manufacturing and commercial monopolies owe their origin not
    to a tendency imminent in a capitalist economy but to
    governmental interventionist policy directed against free trade
    and laissez faire. - Ludwig Mises,</li>

    <li>Experience should teach us to be most on our guard to
    protect liberty when the government's purposes are beneficial -
    the greatest dangers to liberty lurk in insidious encroachment
    by men of zeal, well meaning but without
    understanding. - Supreme Court Justice Louis
    D. Brandeis, 1928</li>

    <li>Tariffs, quotas and other import restrictions protect the
    business of the rich at the expense of high cost of living for
    the poor. Their intent is to deprive you of the right to choose,
    and to force you to buy the high-priced inferior products of
    politically favored companies. - Alan Burris, "A Liberty
    Primer"</li>

    <li>Perhaps the removal of trade restrictions throughout the
    world would do more for the cause of universal peace than can
    any political union of peoples separated by trade
    barriers. - Frank Chodorov</li>

    <li>The legacy of Democrats and Republicans approaches:
    Libertarianism by bankruptcy. - Nick Nuessle, 1992</li>

    <li>Truth and news are not the same thing. - Katharine
    Graham, owner of The Washington Post</li>

    <li>The illegal we do immediately. The unconstitutional takes a
    bit longer. - Henry Kissinger</li>

    <li>We have to offer up scary scenarios, make simplified
    dramatic statements, and make little mention of any doubts we
    may have. Each of us has to decide what the right balance is
    between being effective and being honest. - Stephen
    Schneider, environmental activist, in "Discover", Oct. '89</li>

    <li>I think the terror most people are concerned with is the
    IRS. - Malcolm Forbes, when asked if he was afraid of
    terrorism</li>

    <li>Let the people decide through the marketplace mechanism what
    they wish to see and hear. Why is there this national obsession
    to tamper with this box of transistors and tubes when we don't
    do the same for Time magazine? - Mark Fowler, FCC
    Chairman</li>

    <li>The usual road to slavery is that first they take away your
    guns, then they take away your property, then last of all they
    tell you to shut up and say you are enjoying it. - James
    A. Donald</li>

    <li>Every friend of freedom must be as revolted as I am by the
    prospect of turning the United States into an armed camp, by the
    vision of jails filled with casual drug users and of an army of
    enforcers empowered to invade the liberty of citizens on slight
    evidence. - Milton Friedman, Nobel Prize-winning
    economist</li>

    <li>The high rate of unemployment among teenagers, and
    especially black teenagers, is both a scandal and a serious
    source of social unrest. Yet it is largely a result of minimum
    wage laws. We regard the minimum wage law as one of the most, if
    not the most, anti-black laws on the statute books. -
    Milton Friedman, Nobel Prize-winning economist</li>

    <li>Nothing can destroy a government more quickly than its
    failure to observe its own laws, or worse, its disregard of the
    charter of its own existence - U.S. Supreme Court
    Justice Tom C. Clark - Mapp vs. Ohio</li>

    <li>If we were directed from Washington when to sow and when to
    reap, we would soon want for bread. - Thomas
    Jefferson</li>

    <li>Our forefathers made one mistake. What they should have
    fought for was representation without taxation. -
    Fletcher Knebel, historian</li>

    <li>Those who do not learn from the mistakes of history are
    doomed to repeat them. - George Santayana</li>

    <li>Every man has a property in his own person. This nobody has
    any right to but himself. The labor of his body and the work of
    his hands are properly his. - John Locke, 1690</li>

    <li>There are more instances of the abridgement of the freedom
    of the people by the gradual and silent encroachment of those in
    power, than by violent and sudden usurpation. - James
    Madison</li>

    <li>Taxation of earnings from labor is on a par with forced
    labor. Seizing the results of someone's labor is equivalent to
    seizing hours from him and directing him to carry on various
    activities. - Robert Nozick, Harvard philosopher</li>

    <li>Alcohol didn't cause the high crime rates of the '20s and
    '30s, Prohibition did. And drugs do not cause today's alarming
    crime rates, but drug prohibition does. - US District
    Judge James C. Paine, addressing the Federal Bar Association in
    Miami, November, 1991</li>

    <li>The moral and constitutional obligations of our
    representatives in Washington are to protect our liberty, not
    coddle the world, precipitating no-win wars, while bringing
    bankruptcy and economic turmoil to our people. -
    Congressman Ron Paul, 1987</li>

    <li>The man who produces while others dispose of his product is
    a slave. - Ayn Rand</li>

    <li>I am interested in politics so that one day I will not have
    to be interested in politics. - Ayn Rand</li>

    <li>They have gun control in Cuba. They have universal health
    care in Cuba. So why do they want to come here? - Paul
    Harvey 8/31/94</li>

    <li>Even the most Bush-happy, flag suckling jack-arse knows
    deep-down inside that something is wrong. America is over and
    everyone knows it. The New World Order has a dying empire odor
    and changing the channel ain't going to make this go
    away. - Jello Biafra</li>

    <li>If the jury feels the law is unjust, we recognize the
    undisputed power of the jury to acquit, even if its verdict is
    contrary to the law as given by a judge, and contrary to the
    evidence - and the courts must abide by that
    decision. - US v Moylan, 4th Circuit Court of Appeals,
    1969, 417 F.2d at 1006</li>

    <li>Love your country but fear its government. -
    N.E. folk wisdom</li>

    <li>Where is it written in the Constitution, in what section or
    clause is it contained, that you may take children from their
    parents and parents from their children, and compel them to
    fight the battle in any war in which the folly or the wickedness
    of government may engage it? - Daniel Webster</li>

    <li>There are many farm handouts; but let's call them what they
    really are: a form of legalized theft. Essentially, a
    congressman tells his farm constituency, "Vote for me. I'll use
    my office to take another American's money and give it to you."
    - Walter Williams, economist and syndicated
    columnist</li>

    <li>National Health Insurance means combining the efficiency of
    the Postal Service with the compassion of the I.R.S. - and the
    cost accounting of the Pentagon. - Louis Sullivan/Connie
    Horner quoted by Novak in _Forbes_</li>

    <li>Germans who wish to use firearms should join the SS or the
    SA - ordinary citizens don't need guns, as their having
    guns doesn't serve the State. - Heinrich Himmler</li>

    <li>The Ten Commandments contain 297 words. The Bill of Rights
    is stated in 463 words. Lincoln's Gettysburg Address contains
    266 words. A recent federal directive to regulate the price of
    cabbage contains 26,911 words. - The Atlanta
    Journal</li>

    <li>Government does not grow by seizing our freedoms, but by
    assuming our responsibilities. - Michael Cloud</li>

    <li>The government is good at one thing. It knows how to break
    your legs, and then hand you a crutch and say, "See if it
    weren't for the government, you wouldn't be able to
    walk". - Harry Browne</li>

    <li>Government does not solve problems; it subsidizes
    them. - Ronald Reagan</li>

    freedom. - Justice William O. Douglas</li>

    <li>Why doesn't everybody just leave everybody else the hell
    alone? - Jimmy Durante</li>

    <li>This year will go down in history. For the first time, a
    civilized nation has full gun registration. Our streets will be
    safer, our police more efficient, and the world will follow our
    lead into the future! - Adolph Hitler [1935] The Weapons
    Act of Nazi Germany.</li>

    <li>After a shooting spree, they always want to take the guns
    away from the people who didn't do it. I sure as hell wouldn't
    want to live in a society where the only people allowed guns are
    the police and the military. - William S. Burroughs</li>

    <li>To tax the larger incomes at a higher percentage than the
    smaller, is to lay a tax on industry and economy; to impose a
    penalty on people for having worked harder and saved more than
    their neighbors. - John Stuart Mill</li>

    <li>When taxes are too high, people go hungry. - Lao
    Tsu</li>

    <li>Show me a movement that doesn't hate somebody and I will
    join it at once. - Robert Anton Wilson</li>

    <li>What's *just* has been debated for centuries but let me
    offer you my definition of social justice: I keep what I earn
    and you keep what you earn. Do you disagree? Well then tell me
    how much of what I earn *belongs* to you - and why?
    - Walter Williams</li>

    <li>Disobedience is the true foundation of liberty. The obedient
    must be slaves. - Henry David Thoreau</li>

    <li>No matter how disastrously some policy has turned out,
    anyone who criticizes it can expect to hear: "But what would you
    replace it with?" When you put out a fire, what do you replace
    it with? - Thomas Sowell</li>

    <li>A society that robs an individual of the product of his
    effort - is not strictly speaking a society, but a mob held
    together by institutionalized gang violence. - Ayn
    Rand</li>

    <li>Society in every state is a blessing, but Government, even
    in its best state, is but a necessary evil; in its worst state,
    an intolerable one. - Thomas Paine</li>

    <li>One of the annoying things about believing in free will and
    individual responsibility is the difficulty of finding somebody
    to blame your problems on. And when you do find somebody, it's
    remarkable how often his picture turns up on your driver's
    license. - P.J. O'Rourke</li>

    <li>You cannot help men permanently by doing for them what they
    could and should do for themselves. - Abraham
    Lincoln</li>

    <li>The more laws and restrictions there are, the poorer the
    people become. - Lao Tsu</li>

    <li>When all government, in little as in great things, shall be
    drawn to Washington as the Center of all power, it will render
    powerless the checks provided of one government on another and
    will become as venal and oppressive as the government from which

    they let you in, it is because you are black. That's progress?

    imagine a more alarming situation. -
    Fr�d�ric Bastiat</li>

    through Congress today? It wouldn't even get out of

    with success. They believe you cannot allow people to succeed in
    case those who fail feel worthless. - Kenneth Baker</li>

    <li>Freedom, morality, and the human dignity of the individual

    <li>People fear witches, and burn women. - Justice Louis
    Brandeis</li>

    <li>The American heritage was one of individual liberty,
    personal responsibility and freedom from government -
    Unfortunately - that heritage has been lost. Americans no
    longer have the freedom to direct their own lives - Today, it

    <li>Penalties against possession of a drug should not be more

    freedom, we free ourselves. - Marilyn Ferguson</li>

    <li>Fundamentally, there are only two ways of coordinating the
    economic activities of millions. One is central direction

    voluntary cooperation of individuals - the technique of
    the marketplace. - Milton Friedman</li>

    <li>Civil disobedience becomes a sacred duty when the State
    becomes lawless or, which is the same thing, corrupt. -
    Mohandas Gandhi</li>

    substituting a government more acceptable. - Ulysses

    <li>Past studies by and large confirm the prediction that higher
    minimum wages reduce employment opportunities and raise
    unemployment, particularly among teenagers, minorities and other
    low-skilled workers. - Masanori Hashimoto</li>

    <li>We find many things to which the prohibition of them
    constitutes the only temptation. - William Hazlitt</li>

    <li>Is life so dear, or peace so sweet, as to be purchased at
    the price of chains and slavery! Forbid it, Almighty God! I know
    not what course others may take; but as for me, give me liberty
    or give me death! - Patrick Henry</li>

    <li>The broad masses of a population are more amenable to the
    appeal of rhetoric than to any other force. - Adolf
    Hitler</li>

    <li>I never hurt nobody but myself and that's nobody's business
    but my own. - Billie Holiday</li>

    <li>Historically, much of the motivation for public schooling
    has been to stifle variety and institute social
    control. - Jack Hugh</li>

    <li>When we lose the right to be different, we lose the
    privilege to be free. - Charles Evans Hughes</li>

    <li>I predict future happiness for Americans if they can prevent
    the government from wasting the labors of the people under the
    pretense of taking care of them. - Thomas Jefferson</li>

    <li>It's no accident that capitalism has brought with it
    progress, not merely in production but also in knowledge. Egoism
    and competition are, alas, stronger forces than public spirit
    and sense of duty. - Albert Einstein</li>

    <li>On every question of construction, let us carry ourselves
    back to the time when the Constitution was adopted, recollect
    the spirit manifested in the debates, and instead of trying what
    meaning may be squeezed out of the text, or invented against it,
    conform to the probable one in which it was passed. -
    Thomas Jefferson</li>

    <li>According to George Hitchings, co-winner of the 1988 Nobel

    <li>He who passively accepts evil is as much involved in it as
    he who helps to perpetuate it. - Martin Luther King,

    <li>I let go of all desire for the common good, and the good
    becomes as common as the grass. - Lao Tsu</li>

    <li>If men are good, you don't need government; if men are evil
    or ambivalent, you don't dare have one. - Robert
    LeFevre</li>

    <li>Low-income workers as a group are the major victims of
    minimum wage legislation. - Keith B. Leffler</li>

    <li>Prohibition goes beyond the bounds of reason in that it
    attempts to control a man's appetite by legislation and makes
    crimes out of things that are not crimes. A prohibition law
    strikes a blow at the very principles upon which our government
    was founded. - Abraham Lincoln</li>

    <li>Public educators, like Soviet farmers, lack any incentive to
    produce results, innovate, to be efficient, to make the kinds of
    difficult changes that private firms operating in a competitive
    market must make to survive. - Carolyn Lochhead</li>

    <li>Those who attack the rationale of the game, and not the
    players, are its most formidable adversaries. - James
    J. Martin</li>

    <li>Truth resides in every human heart, and one has to search
    for it there, and to be guided by truth as one sees it. But no
    one has a right to coerce others to act according to his own
    view of truth. - Mohandas Gandhi</li>

    <li>If you can cut the people off from their history, then they
    can be easily persuaded. - Karl Marx</li>

    <li>Depressions and mass unemployment are not caused by the free
    market but by government interference in the economy. -
    Ludwig von Mises</li>

    <li>When they took the 4th Amendment, I was quiet because I
    didn't deal drugs.</li> When they took the 6th Amendment, I was
    quiet because I am innocent.  When they took the 2nd Amendment,
    <li> I was quiet because I don't own a gun.  Now they have taken
    the</li> 1st Amendment, and I can only be quiet. - Lyle
    Myhr <li></li> In Germany, they first came for the communists,
    and I didn't speak up because I wasn't a communist. Then, they
    <li> came for the Jews, and I didn't speak up because I wasn't a
    Jew - </li> Then they came for the Catholics. I didn't speak up
    then because I was a Protestant. Then they came for me, and <li>
    there was no one left to speak up. - Reverend
    Martin</li> Niemoller, German Lutheran pastor arrested by the
    Gestapo in 1937.  <li></li> It is a popular delusion that the
    government wastes vast amounts of money through inefficiency and
    <li> sloth. Enormous effort and elaborate planning are required
    to</li> waste this much money. - P.J. O'Rourke

    <li>Petty laws breed great crimes. - Ouida</li>

    <li>The essential psychological requirement of a free society is
    the willingness on the part of the individual to accept
    responsibility for his life. - Edith Packer</li>

    <li>When the government fears the people, it is liberty. When
    the people fear the government, it is tyranny. - Thomas
    Paine</li>

    <li>The course of history shows that as a government grows,
    liberty decreases. - Thomas Jefferson</li>

    <li>The most important element of a free society, where
    individual rights are held in the highest esteem, is the
    rejection of the initiation of violence. All initiation of force
    is a violation of someone else's rights, whether initiated by an
    individual or the state, for the benefit of an individual or
    group of individuals, even if it's supposed to be for the
    benefit of another individual or group of
    individuals. Legitimate use of violence can only be that which
    is required in self-defense. - Congressman Ron Paul, (R)
    Texas</li>

    <li>As you increase the cost of the license to practice
    medicine, you increase the price at which the medical service
    must be sold and you correspondingly decrease the number of
    people who can afford to buy the service. - William
    Pusey, then president of the American Medical Association</li>

    <li>The smallest minority on earth is the individual. Those who
    deny individual rights cannot claim to be defenders of
    minorities. - Ayn Rand</li>

    <li>The American Dream was not about government's taking huge
    sums of money (under the label of "taxation") from citizens by
    force. The American Dream was about individualism and the
    opportunity to achieve success without interference from
    others. - Robert Ringer</li>

    <li>Things in our country run in spite of government, not by aid
    of it. - Will Rogers</li>

    <li>I am convinced that we can do to guns what we've done to
    drugs: create a multi-billion dollar underground market over
    which we have absolutely no control. - George
    L. Roman</li>

    <li>The old parties are husks, with no real soul within either,
    divided on artificial lines, boss-ridden and
    privilege-controlled, each a jumble of incongruous elements, and
    neither daring to speak out wisely and fearlessly on what should
    be said on the vital issues of the day. - Theodore
    Roosevelt</li>

    <li>Laws do not persuade just because they threaten. -
    Seneca</li>

    <li>Armed people are free. No state can control those who have
    the machinery and the will to resist, no mob can take their
    liberty and property. And no 220-pound thug can threaten the
    well-being or dignity of a 110-pound woman who has two pounds of
    iron to even things out - People who object to weapons aren't
    abolishing violence, they're begging for rule by brute force,
    when the biggest, strongest animals among men were always
    automatically "right." Guns ended that, and a social democracy
    is a hollow farce without an armed populace to make it
    work. - L. Neil Smith (from The Probability Broach)</li>

    <li>Let him who would move the world, first move
    himself. - Socrates</li>

    <li>What is ominous is the ease with which some people go from
    saying that they don't like something to saying that the
    government should forbid it. When you go down that road, don't
    expect freedom to survive very long. - Thomas
    Sowell</li>

    <li>The only tyrant I accept in this world is the still voice
    within. - Mohandas Gandhi</li>

    <li>However insignificant the minority, and however trifling the
    proposed trespass against their rights, no such trespass is
    permissible. - Herbert Spencer (from "The Right To
    Ignore The State")</li>

    <li>The highwayman takes solely upon himself the responsibility,
    danger, and crime of his own act. He does not pretend that he
    has any rightful claim to your money, or that he intends to use
    it for your own benefit - Furthermore, having taken your money,
    he leaves you, as you wish him to do - He does not keep
    "protecting" you by commanding you to bow down and serve him; by
    requiring you to do this, and forbidding you to do
    that. - Lysander Spooner</li>

    <li>If I were a Brazilian without land or money or the means to
    feed my children, I would be burning the rain forest
    too. - Sting</li>

    <li>I favor free trade in drugs for the same reason the Founding
    Fathers favored free trade in ideas: in a free society it is
    none of the government's business what ideas a man puts into his
    mind; likewise, it should be none of its business what drugs he
    puts into his body. - Thomas Szasz</li>

    <li>That government is best which governs least. - Henry
    David Thoreau</li>

    <li>In the beginning of a change, the Patriot is a scarce man
    and brave, hated and scorned. When his cause succeeds however,
    the timid join him, for then it costs nothing to be a
    Patriot. - Mark Twain</li>

    <li>I love my country far too much to be a
    nationalist. - Unknown</li>

    <li>I may not agree with what you say, but I will defend to the
    death your right to say it. - Voltaire</li>

    <li>If even one new drug of the stature of penicillin or
    digitalis has been unjustifiably banished to a company's back
    shelf because of exceedingly stringent regulatory requirements,
    that event will have harmed more people than all the toxicity
    that has occurred in the history of modern drug
    development. - William Wardell</li>

    <li>It rankles me when somebody tries to force somebody to do
    something. - John Wayne</li>

    <li>Before a standing army can rule, the people must be
    disarmed; as they are in almost every kingdom of Europe. The
    supreme power in America cannot enforce unjust laws by the
    sword; because the whole body of people are armed, and
    constitute a force superior to any body of regular troops that
    can be, on any pretense, raised in the United States. -
    Noah Webster</li>

    <li>Only in a police state is the job of a policeman
    easy. - Orson Welles</li>

    <li>Liberals believe government should take people's earnings to
    give to poor people. Conservatives disagree. They think
    government should confiscate people's earnings and give them to
    farmers and insolvent banks. The compelling issue to both
    conservatives and liberals is not whether it is legitimate for
    government to confiscate one's property to give to another, the
    debate is over the disposition of the pillage. - Walter
    Williams</li>

    <li>Taking somebody's money without permission is stealing,
    unless you work for the IRS; then it's taxation. Killing people
    en masse is homicidal mania, unless you work for the Army; then
    it's National Defense. Spying on your neighbors is invasion of
    privacy, unless you work for the FBI; then it's National
    Security. Running a whorehouse makes you a pimp and poisoning
    people makes you a murderer, unless you work for the CIA; then
    it's counter-intelligence. - Robert Anton Wilson</li>

    <li>Government, in it's last analysis, is organized
    force. - Woodrow Wilson</li>

    <li>Any fool can make a rule, and every fool will mind
    it. - Cousin Woodman</li>

    <li>The proper direction of man's thought is not toward the
    creation of new laws for government, but toward the acceptance
    of every person's moral dignity. - Edmund Yates</li>

    <li>The higher entry standards imposed by licensing laws reduce
    the supply of professional services - The poor are the net
    losers, because the availability of low-cost service has been
    reduced. In essence, the poor subsidize the information research
    costs of the rich. - S. David Young</li>

    <li>The pages of history shine on instances of the jury's
    exercise of its prerogative to disregard instructions of the
    judge. - U.S. vs. Dougherty, 1972</li>

    <li>The people of the various provinces are strictly forbidden
    to have in their possession any swords, bows, spears, firearms
    or other types of arms. The possession of these elements makes
    difficult the collection of taxes and dues, and tends to permit
    uprising. - Toyotomi Hideyoshi, Japanese Shogun, August
    29, 1558</li>

    <li>We ask that the government undertake the obligation above
    all of providing citizens with adequate opportunity for
    employment and earning a living. The activities of the
    individual must not be allowed to clash with the interests of
    the community, but must take place within its confines and be
    for the good of all. Therefore, we demand: - an end to the
    power of the financial interests. We demand profit sharing in
    big business. We demand a broad extension of care for the
    aged. We demand - the greatest possible consideration of small
    business in the purchases of national, state, and municipal
    governments. In order to make possible to every capable and
    industrious [citizen] the attainment of higher education and
    thus the achievement of a post of leadership, the government
    must provide an all-around enlargement of our entire system of
    public education - We demand the education at government
    expense of gifted children of poor parents - The government
    must undertake the improvement of public health - by
    protecting mother and child, by prohibiting child labor - by
    the greatest possible support for all clubs concerned with the
    physical education of youth. We combat the - materialistic
    spirit within and without us, and are convinced that a permanent
    recovery of our people can only proceed from within on the
    foundation of the common good before the individual
    good. - From the political program of the Nazi Party,
    adopted in Munich, February 24, 1920</li>

    <li>I ask, sir, what is the militia? It is the whole people,
    except for a few public officials. - George Mason.</li>

    <li>The proverb warns that "You should not bite the hand that

    <li>Pay no attention to that man behind the curtain. -
    The Wizard of Oz</li>

    <li>People who create things nowadays can expect to be
    prosecuted by highly moralistic people who are incapable of
    creating anything. There is no way to measure the chilling
    effect on innovation that results from the threats of taxation,
    regulation and prosecution against anything that succeeds. We'll
    never know how many ideas our government has aborted in the name
    protecting us. - Joseph Sobran May 13, 1998 (commenting
    on US vs Microsoft)</li>

    <li>I believe the states can best govern our home concerns and
    the federal government our foreign ones. - Thomas
    Jefferson</li>

    <li>It took about 150 years, starting with a Bill of Rights that
    reserved to the states and the people all powers not explicitly
    delegated to the federal government, to produce a Supreme Court
    willing to rule that growing corn to feed to your own hogs is
    interstate commerce and can therefore be regulated by
    Congress. - David Friedman, The Machinery of
    Freedom</li>

    <li>I regret to say that we of the FBI are powerless to act in
    cases of oral-genital intimacy, unless it has in some way
    obstructed interstate commerce. - J. Edgar Hoover</li>

    <li>First, God created idiots. That was just for practice. Then
    He created school boards. - Mark Twain</li>

    <li>The politician attempts to remedy the evil by increasing the
    very thing that caused the evil in the first place: legal
    plunder. - Fr�d�ric Bastiat</li>

    <li>The police can't stop an intruder, mugger, or stalker from
    hurting you. They can pursue him only after he has hurt or
    killed you. Protecting yourself from harm is your
    responsibility, and you are far less likely to be hurt in a
    neighborhood of gun-owners than in one of disarmed citizens
    - even if you don't own a gun yourself. - Harry
    Browne</li>

    <li>The only thing necessary for evil to triumph is for good men
    to do nothing. - Edmund Burke</li>

    <li>Patriotism means loving our country, not the
    government. - Michael Cloud</li>

    <li>Conservatives and liberals are kindred spirits as far as
    government spending is concerned. First, let's make sure we
    understand what government spending is. Since government has no
    resources of its own, and since there's no Tooth Fairy handing
    Congress the funds for the programs it enacts, we are forced to
    recognize that government spending is no less than the
    confiscation of one person's property to give it to another to
    whom it does not belong - in effect, legalized
    theft. - Walter Williams</li>

    <li>The Constitution is not neutral. It was designed to take the
    government off the backs of people. - Justice William
    O. Douglas</li>

    <li>The prestige of government has undoubtedly been lowered
    considerably by the Prohibition law. For nothing is more
    destructive of respect for the government and the law of the
    land than passing laws which cannot be enforced. It is an open
    secret that the dangerous increase of crime in this country is
    closely connected with this. - Albert Einstein</li>

    <li>I'm in favor of legalizing drugs. According to my value
    system, if people want to kill themselves, they have every right
    to do so. Most of the harm that comes from drugs is because they
    are illegal. - Milton Friedman</li>

    <li>One who uses coercion is guilty of deliberate
    violence. Coercion is inhuman. - Mohandas Gandhi</li>

    <li>The policy of the American government is to leave their
    citizens free, neither restraining nor aiding them in their
    pursuits. - Thomas Jefferson</li>

    <li>There comes a time when a moral man can't obey a law which
    his conscience tells him is unjust. - Martin Luther
    King, Jr.</li>

    <li>The greater the number of laws and enactments, the more
    thieves and robbers there will be. - Lao Tsu</li>

    <li>You know, if government were a product, selling it would be
    illegal. Government is a health hazard. Governments have killed
    many more people than cigarettes or unbuckled seat belts ever
    have. - P.J. O'Rourke</li>

    <li>A body of men holding themselves accountable to nobody ought
    not to be trusted by anybody. - Thomas Paine</li>

    <li>Wealth comes from successful individual efforts to please
    one's fellow man - that's what competition is all about:
    "outpleasing" your competitors to win over the
    consumers. - Walter Williams</li>

    <li>To me, it doesn't matter if your scapegoats are the Jews,
    the homosexuals, the male sex, the Masons, the Jesuits, the
    Welfare Parasites, the Power Elite, the female sex, the
    vegetarians, or the Communist Party. To the extent that you need
    a scapegoat, you simply have not got your brain programmed to
    work as an efficient problem-solving machine. - Robert
    Anton Wilson</li>

    <li>A strong body makes a strong mind. As to the species of
    exercise I advise the gun. While this gives moderate exercise to
    the body it gives boldness, enterprise and independence to the
    mind. Let your gun, therefore, be the constant companion of your
    walks. - Thomas Jefferson</li>

    <li>The World's Smallest Political Quiz is the single best
    outreach tool we libertarians have. -George Getz,
    Libertarian Party press secretary</li>

    <li>Gun control? It's the best thing you can do for crooks and
    gangsters. I want you to have nothing. If I'm a bad guy, I'm
    always gonna have a gun. Safety locks? You will pull the trigger
    with a lock on, and I'll pull the trigger. We'll see who
    wins. - Sammy "The Bull" Gravano, whose testimony
    convicted John Gotti</li>

    <li>Those who cast the votes decide nothing. Those who count the
    votes decide everything. - Josef V. Stalin</li>

    <li>In our desire to have government become our benefactor and
    sustainer, we have allowed it to become our taskmaster and
    overlord. As a result, we have become little more than well-fed,
    well-entertained slaves to the state. Freedom, as envisioned by
    our forefathers, is gone. - Chuck Baldwin 2001
    (www.chuckbaldwinlive.com)</li>

    <li>To preserve liberty, it is essential that the whole body of
    the people always possess arms, and be taught alike, especially
    when young, how to use them. - Richard Henry Lee (who
    drafted the Second Amendment as well as the rest of the Bill of
    Rights) 1788</li>

    <li>Faced with the pain of freedom, man begs for his
    shackles. - Gerry Spence</li>

    <li>I say that the Second Amendment doesn't allow for exceptions
    - or else it would have read that the right "to keep and
    bear arms shall not be infringed, unless Congress chooses
    otherwise." And because there are no exceptions, I disagree with
    my fellow panelists who say the existing gun laws should be
    enforced. Those laws are unconstitutional [and] wrong -
    because they put you at a disadvantage to armed criminals, to
    whom the laws are no inconvenience. - Harry Browne,
    meetings with NRA's EVP, Wayne LaPierre and other panelists at a
    gun rights rally in Hot Springs, AR, 8/8/2000</li>

    <li>The angels and the devils are definitely within us, not
    within the machines we use. - Michael Dertouzos</li>

    <li>The limitation of tyrants is the endurance of those they

    <li>The only thing that saves us from bureaucracy is its
    inefficiency. - Eugene McCarthy</li>

    <li>The jury has the right to judge both the law as well as the
    fact in controversy. - John Jay, Joint-author of the
    Federalist Papers and first U. S. Supreme Court Chief
    Justice</li>

    <li>There ain't no rules around here! We're trying to accomplish
    something. - Thomas Edison</li>

    <li>The ideal Government of all reflective men, from Aristotle
    onward, is one which lets the individual alone - one
    which barely escapes being no government at all. -
    H. L. Mencken</li>

    <li>Most economic fallacies derive - from the tendency to
    assume that there is a fixed pie, that one party can gain only
    at the expense of another. - Milton Friedman, Economic
    Freedom and Representative Government; 1973</li>

    <li>Freedom is essentially a condition of inequality, not
    equality. It recognizes as a fact of nature the structural
    differences inherent in man - in temperament, character,
    and capacity - and it respects those differences. We are
    not alike and no law can make us so. - Frank
    Chodorov</li>

    <li>When government accepts responsibility for people, then
    people no longer take responsibility for themselves. -
    George Pataki</li>

    <li>Freedom is a fragile thing and is never more than one
    generation away from extinction. - Ronald Reagan</li>

    <li>The cure for evil and disorder is more liberty, not
    suppression. - Alexander Berkman</li>

    <li>Live and let live. - Friedrich von Schiller</li>

    <li>The most dangerous man to any government is the man who is
    able to think things out for himself, without regard to the
    prevailing superstitions and taboos. Almost inevitably he comes
    to the conclusion that the government he lives under is
    dishonest, insane, and intolerable - -
    H. L. Mencken</li>

    <li>It is better to die on your feet than live on your
    knees. - Emiliano Zapta, Mexican revolutionary</li>

    <li>The times call for courage. The times call for hard
    work. But if the demands are high, it is because the stakes are
    even higher. They are nothing less than the future of human
    liberty, which means the future of civilization. - Henry
    Hazlitt</li>

    <li>Blacks were not enslaved because they were black but because
    they were available. Slavery has existed in the world for
    thousands of years. Whites enslaved other whites in Europe for
    centuries before the first black was brought to the Western
    hemisphere. Asians enslaved Europeans. Asians enslaved other
    Asians. Africans enslaved other Africans, and indeed even today
    in North Africa, blacks continue to enslave blacks. -
    Thomas Sowell, a black sociologist, author and columnist</li>

    <li>To sin by silence when they should protest makes cowards of
    men. - Abraham Lincoln</li>

    <li>These are the times that try men's souls. The summer soldier
    and the sunshine patriot will, in this crisis, shrink from the
    service of his country; but he that stands it now deserves the
    love and thanks of man and woman. Heaven knows how to put a
    proper price upon its goods; and it would be strange indeed if
    so celestial an article as Freedom should not be highly
    rated. - Thomas Paine</li>

    <li>We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are
    created equal, that they are endowed by their creator with
    certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty,
    and the pursuit of happiness. - The Declaration of
    Independence</li>

    <li>Truth is not only violated by falsehood; it may be equally
    outraged by silence. - Henri Frederic Amiel</li>

    <li>Liberty is always unfinished business. -
    Anonymous</li>

    <li>And now that the legislators and do gooders have futilely
    inflicted so many systems upon society, may they finally end
    where they should have begun: May they reject all systems. And
    try liberty - - Frederic Bastiat, 1850</li>

    <li>Everyone carries a part of society on his shoulders; no one
    is relieved of his share of responsibility by others. And no one
    can find a safe way out for himself if society is sweeping
    towards destruction. Therefore, everyone, in his own interests,
    must thrust himself vigorously into the intellectual
    battle. None can stand aside with unconcern; the interests of
    everyone hangs on the results. Whether he chooses or not, every
    man is drawn into the greatest historical struggle, the decisive
    battle into which our epoch has plunged us. - Ludwig von
    Mises</li>

    <li>If our country is to survive and prosper, we must summon the
    courage to condemn and reject the liberal agenda, and we had
    better do it soon. - Walter E. Williams, "The Gathering
    Racial Tragedy"</li>

    <li>I think we need to find out why the citizens of the world's
    wealthiest, most envied, most powerful country are so cynical,
    so distressed, so angry, so ticked of about so many
    things. - William J. Bennett, former Secretary of
    Education.</li>

    <li>If you want a picture of the future, imagine a boot stamping
    on a human face - forever. - George Orwell,
    1984</li>

    <li>Not only can no one predict the future, we don't understand
    the present - and there isn't even any certainty about
    the past. - Harry Browne</li>

    <li>A man who walks down the centre line of a road risks getting
    hit from both sides. - Alexander Ziatanovic</li>

    <li>It ain't so much what a man doesn't know that causes him so
    many problems, but what he knows that ain't so. - Will
    Rogers</li>

    <li>To take what there is, and use it, without waiting forever
    in vain for the preconceived - to dig deep into the
    actual and get something out of it - this doubtless is
    the right way to live. - Henry James</li>

    <li>The devil can cite Scripture for his purpose. -
    Shakespeare</li>

    <li>Men are most apt to believe what they least
    understand. - Montaigne</li>

    <li>When a well-packaged web of lies has been sold gradually to
    the masses over generations, the truth will seem utterly
    preposterous and its speaker a raving lunatic. - Dresden
    James</li>

    <li>I have thought that a man of tolerable abilities may work
    great changes if he first forms a good plan and makes the
    execution of that same plan his whole study and
    business. - Benjamin Franklin</li>

    <li>For all the sad words of tongue or pen, the saddest are
    these, "It might have been!" - John Greenleaf
    Whittier</li>

    <li>It takes time to ruin a world, but time is all it
    takes. - Bernard DeFoutenelle</li>

    <li>People never believe in volcanoes until the lava actually
    overtakes them. - George Santayana</li>

    <li>After you've heard two eyewitness accounts of an auto
    accident, it makes you wonder about history. - Bits &
    Pieces</li>

    <li>A nation which does not remember what it was yesterday does
    not know where it is today. - Robert E. Lee</li>

    <li>Ever since its founding in 1913, the Fed has described
    itself as an "independent" agency operated by selfless public
    servants striving to "fine-tune" the economy through monetary
    policy. In reality, however, a non-political governmental
    institution is as likely as a barking cat. - Thomas
    J. DiLorenzo</li>

    <li>I do not deny the allegation, I deny the
    allegator. - Jesse Jackson [!]</li>

    <li>Those who take the most from the table, teach
    contentment. Those for whom the taxes are destined, demand
    sacrifice. Those who eat their fill, speak to the hungry, of
    wonderful times to come. Those who lead the country into the
    abyss, call ruling difficult, for ordinary folk. -
    Bertolt Brecht</li>

    <li>The worst forms of tyranny, or certainly the most successful
    ones, are not those we rail against but those that so insinuate
    themselves into the imagery of our consciousness, and the fabric
    of our lives, as not to be perceived as tyranny. -
    Michael Parenti</li>

    <li>Any story sounds true until someone tells the other side and
    sets the record straight. - Proverbs 18:17</li>

    <li>War is peace; freedom is slavery; ignorance is
    strength. - George Orwell</li>

    <li>The Revolution will be complete when the language is
    perfect. - George Orwell, 1984</li>

    <li>For the totalitarian mind, adherence to state propaganda
    does not suffice: one must display proper enthusiasm while
    marching in the parade. - Noam Chomsky</li>

    <li>Restriction of free thought and free speech is the most
    dangerous of all subversions. It is the one un-American act that
    could most easily defeat us all. - Justice William
    O. Douglas</li>

    <li>An editor is one who separates the wheat from the chaff and
    prints the chaff. - Adlai Stevenson</li>

    <li>The man who reads nothing at all is better educated than the
    man who reads nothing but the newspapers. - Thomas
    Jefferson</li>

    <li>When the mass media in some foreign countries serve as
    megaphones for the rhetoric of their government, the result is
    ludicrous propaganda. When the mass media in our country serve
    as megaphones for the rhetoric of the U.S. government, the
    result is responsible journalism. - Norman Solomon</li>

    <li>A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of
    a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear arms,
    shall not be infringed. - Second Amendment to the
    Constitution</li>

    <li>An armed society is a polite society. - Robert
    A. Heinlein</li>

    <li>The aim of public education is not to spread enlightenment
    at all, it is simply to reduce as many individuals as possible
    to the same safe level, to breed and train a standardized
    citizenry, to put down dissent and originality. - H
    L. Mencken</li>

    <li>We must remember that government, no matter how hard it
    tries, cannot protect an individual from themselves. This
    legislation is simply one more attempt by big government to tell
    us that they know what is best for us. It is not the first time
    and it will not be the last. - Peter Calcagno</li>

    <li>Washington is not America. It has become an alien city-state
    that rules America, and much of the rest of the world, in the
    way that Rome ruled the Roman Empire. - Richard
    Maybury</li>

    <li>How fortunate for governments that the people they
    administer don't think. - Adolf Hitler</li>

    <li>Now that I look back, I realize that a life predicated on
    being obedient is a very comfortable life indeed. Living in such
    a way reduces to a minimum one's own need to think. -
    Adolf Eichmann, Memoirs written after his 1960 capture by
    Israel.</li>

    <li>A man's home may be his castle, but that does not keep the
    government from taking it. - United States v. Hendler,
    952 F2d 1364 (Fed Cir 1991)</li>

    <li>Arbitrary power is most easily established on the ruins of
    liberty abused to licentiousness. - George
    Washington</li>

    <li>A State which dwarfs its men, in order that they may be more
    docile instruments in its hands even for beneficial purposes
    - will find that with small men no great thing can
    really be accomplished. - John Stuart Mill</li>

    <li>The more power a government has the more it can act
    arbitrarily according to the whims and desires of the elite, and
    the more it will make war on others and murder its foreign and
    domestic subjects. The more constrained the power of
    governments, the more power is diffused, checked, and balanced,
    the less it will aggress on others and commit
    democide. - R. J. Rummel, Death by Government</li>

    <li>A nation that expects the government to prevent churches
    from burning, to control the price of bread or gasoline, to
    secure every job, and to find some villain for every dramatic
    accident risks an even larger loss of life and
    liberty. - William A. Niskanen, For a Less Responsive
    Government, Cato Policy Report,</li>

    <li>The state calls its own violence law, but that of the
    individual crime. - Max Stirner</li>

    <li>The pattern is as old as human life. The new rulers use more
    and more force, more police, more soldiers, trying to enforce
    more efficient control, trying to make the planned economy work
    by piling regulations on regulations, decree on decree. The
    people are hungry and hungrier. And how does a man on this earth
    get butter? Doesn't the government give butter? But government
    does not produce food from the earth; Government is guns. It is
    one common distinction of all civilized peoples, that they give
    their guns to the Government. Men in Government monopolize the
    necessary use of force; they are not using their energies
    productively; they are not milking cows. To get butter, they
    must use guns; they have nothing else to use. - Rose
    Wilder Lane</li>

    <li>The state is a force incarnate. Worse, it is the silly
    parading of force. It never seeks to prevail by
    persuasion. Whenever it thrusts its finger into anything it does
    so in the most unfriendly way. Its essence is command and
    compulsion. - Michael Bakunin</li>

    <li>In every State, the government is nothing but a permanent
    conspiracy on the part of the minority against the majority,
    which it enslaves and fleeces. - Michael Bakunin</li>

    <li>We are going to tax and tax, spend and spend, elect and
    elect. - Franklin D. Roosevelt</li>

    <li>- thou shall not steal, even by majority vote - -
    Gary North; Conspiracy</li>

    <li>In levying taxes and in shearing sheep, it is well to stop
    when you get down to the skin. - Austin O'Malley</li>

    <li>Public works are not accomplished by the miraculous power of
    a magic wand. They are paid for by funds taken away from the
    citizens. - Ludwig von Mises</li>

    <li>A [tax loophole is] something that benefits the other
    guy. If it benefits you, it is tax reform. - Russell
    B. Long</li>

    <li>[S]tatism is but socialized dishonesty; it is feathering the
    nests of some with feathers coercively plucked from others
    - on the grand scale. There is no moral difference
    between the act of a pickpocket and the progressive income tax
    or any other social program. - Leonard Read</li>

    <li>There's another major hurdle to a new year of prosperity:
    our tax code. No human being understands it. The current code,
    which runs over 8,000 pages and countless thousands more pages
    of IRS rulings and interpretations, is beyond
    redemption. ..Incalculable amounts of the nation's intellectual
    brainpower are devoted to the dead-end task of coping with the
    current tax code. Over one-half million people in the U.S. make
    their living off it, whether in lobbying, lawyering, tax
    preparing, or accounting. - Americans spend five and one-half
    billion hours a year filling out tax forms - and spend between
    $100 billion and $300 billion to comply with the current
    code. - Malcolm S. Forbes,</li>

    <li>In increasing numbers, Americans believe that it is the
    responsibility - nay, the duty - of the federal
    government to take the earnings of some Americans and
    redistribute them to other Americans for various and sundry
    "good" reasons including "fairness." Citizens who know it is
    wrong to use force to take money from a neighbor have
    rationalized that it is OK for the government to do it for
    them. - Linda Bowles, nationally syndicated
    columnist</li>

    <li>The average family pays more in taxes than it spends on
    food, clothing, and shelter combined. - Congressman Dick
    Armey, Why a Flat Tax? Durell Journal of Money and Banking,
    Spring 1995</li>

    <li>The control of the production of wealth is the control of
    human life itself. - Hilaire Belloc</li>

    <li>How ever sugarcoated and ambiguous, every form of
    authoritarianism must start with a belief in some group's
    greater right to power, whether that right is justified by sex,
    race, religion or all four. - Gloria Steinem, American
    feminist</li>

    <li>Opium and morphine are certainly dangerous, habit-forming
    drugs. But once the principle is admitted that it is the duty of
    the government to protect the individual against his own
    foolishness, no serious objections can be advanced against
    further encroachments - Is not the harm a man can inflict on
    his mind and soul even more disastrous than any bodily evils.?
    Why not prevent him from reading bad books and bad plays, from
    looking at bad paintings and statues and from hearing bad music?
    The mischief done by bad ideologies, surely, is much more
    pernicious both for the individual and for the whole society,
    than that done by narcotic drugs. - Von Mises, Human
    Action</li>

    <li>The present struggle seems less about abolishing big
    government than about who gets to use it. - William
    Greider, One World Ready or Not</li>

    <li>Man is born free, yet he is everywhere in chains. -
    Jean Jacques Rosseau. The Social Contract, 1762</li>

    <li>Pugsley's First Law of Government: All government programs
    accomplish the opposite of what they are designed to
    achieve. - John Pugsley</li>

    <li>Everything government touches turns to crap. - Ringo
    Starr</li>

    <li>One of the things the government can't do is run
    anything. The only things our government runs are the post
    office and the railroads, and both of them are
    bankrupt. - Lee Iacocca</li>

    <li>With all that IMF money, the Thailand's and Mexico's are
    spared the consequences of their fiscal incompetence, and Wall
    Street's heavy hitters are spared the consequences of their
    stupid investments. The global economy is a rigged game, rigged
    so Third World politicians, rich investors and global
    corporations win - and U.S. taxpayers lose. -
    Patrick J. Buchanan</li>

    <li>Every actual State is corrupt. Good men must not obey the
    laws too well. - Ralph Waldo Emerson</li>

    <li>A union of government and religion tends to destroy
    government and degrade religion. - Hugo Black</li>

    <li>If you're going to sin, sin against God, not the
    bureaucracy. God will forgive you but the bureaucracy
    won't. - Hyman G. Rickover</li>

    <li>If we do not halt this steady process of building
    commissions and regulatory bodies and the special legislation
    like huge inverted pyramids over every one of the simple
    constitutional provisions, we shall soon be spending many
    billions of dollars more. - Franklin D. Roosevelt</li>

    <li>The proper and limited use of government is to invoke a
    common justice and keep the peace - and that is
    all. - Leonard Read</li>

    <li>I am not a friend to a very energetic government. It is
    always oppressive. - Thomas Jefferson</li>

    <li>The bureaucrat's first objective, of course, is preservation
    of his job - provided by the big-government system, at
    the taxpayers expense. - Whether real world problems get solved
    or not is of secondary importance. It doesn't take much
    cynicism, in fact, to see that the bureaucrats have a vested
    interest in not having problems solved. If the problems did not
    exist (or had been invented), there would be no reason for the
    bureaucrat to have a job" - William Simon, former U.S
    Treasury Secretary</li>

    <li>What is so bad about big government? My indictment of big
    government is that it is bad because it attacks liberty,
    prosperity, progress, harmony, and morality. Thanks to big
    government, we have significantly less of all of those good
    things than we would if we had been able to keep government
    right-sized. Big government is cancerous. Like a cancer, it
    hurts the body and tends to spread, doing more and more harm as
    it grows. It is time for some radical surgery. - George
    C. Leef, director of FEE's Freeman Society Discussion Clubs</li>

    <li>Bureaucrats write memoranda both because they appear to be
    busy when they are writing and because the memos, once written,
    immediately become proof that they were busy. - Charles
    Peters, How Washington Really Works</li>

    <li>We have the power to do any damn fool thing we want to do,
    and we seem to do it about every 10 minutes. -
    J. William Fulbright</li>

    <li>The era of big government is over. - Bill Clinton,
    State of the Union Address, January 23, 1996</li>

    <li>A tiny and closed fraternity of privileged men, elected by
    no one, and enjoying a monopoly sanctioned and licensed by
    government. - Spiro T. Agnew</li>

    <li>A bureaucrat is the most despicable of men, though he is
    needed as vultures are needed, but one hardly admires vultures
    whom bureaucrats so strangely resemble. I have yet to meet a
    bureaucrat who was not petty, dull, almost witless, crafty or
    stupid, an oppressor or a thief, a holder of little authority in
    which he delights, as a boy delights in possessing a vicious
    dog. Who can trust such creatures? - Cicero</li>

    <li>You can't give the government the power to do good without
    also giving it the power to do bad - in fact, to do
    anything it wants. - Harry Browne</li>

    <li>Once upon a time, government budgets were balanced, our
    money was sound, the streets were safe, and taxes imposed by all
    levels of government took less than 10% of our income. -
    Harry Browne</li>

    <li>Through an unwieldy combination of big government, big
    military, big business, big labor and big cities, we have
    created an unworkable mega-nation which defies central
    management and control. Not only is the United States too big,
    but it has also become too authoritarian and too undemocratic,
    and its states assume too little responsibility for the solution
    of their own social, economic, and political problems. -
    Dr. Thomas Naylor, professor emeritus of economics at Duke
    University</li>

    <li>The greater the power, the more dangerous the
    abuse. - Edmund Burke</li>

    <li>Those who have been once intoxicated with power, and have
    derived any kind of emolument from it, even though but for one
    year, can never willingly abandon it. - Edmund
    Burke</li>

    <li>The power which a multiple millionaire, who may be my
    neighbor and perhaps my employer, has over me is very much less
    than that which the smallest "functionaire" possesses who wields
    the coercive power of the state, and on whose desecration it
    depends whether and how I am allowed to live or to
    work. - Frederich von Hayek, The Road to Serfdom</li>

    <li>Of all 36 ways to get out of trouble, the best way is
    - leave. - Chinese Proverb</li>

    <li>Few of us can easily surrender our belief that society must
    somehow make sense. The thought that the State has lost its mind
    and is punishing so many innocent people is intolerable. And so
    the evidence has to be internally denied. - Arthur
    Miller</li>

    <li>Men never do evil so completely and cheerfully as when they
    do it from mistaken conviction. - Blaise Pascal</li>

    <li>Bad laws are the worst sort of tyranny. - Edmund
    Burke</li>

    <li>A government is not legitimate merely because it
    exists. - Jeane J. Kirkpatrick</li>

    <li>Resistance to tyranny is service to God. - James
    Madison</li>

    <li>We do many things at the federal level that would be
    considered dishonest and illegal if done in the private
    sector. - Donald T. Regan</li>

    <li>[During the 20th century] - 170 million men, women, and
    children have been shot, beaten, tortured, knifed, burned,
    starved, frozen, crushed, or worked to death; buried alive,
    drowned, hung, bombed, or killed in any other of the myriad ways
    governments have inflicted death on unarmed, helpless citizens
    and foreigners. - R. J. Rummel, Death by Government</li>

    <li>Single acts of tyranny may be ascribed to the accidental
    opinion of a day. But a series of oppressions, begun at a
    distinguished period, and pursued unalterably through every
    change of ministers, too plainly proves a deliberate systematic
    plan of reducing us to slavery. - Thomas Jefferson</li>

    <li>This and no other is the root from which a tyrant springs;
    when he first appears he is a protector. - Plato circa
    400 B.C.</li>

    <li>The ideal tyranny is that which is ignorantly
    self-administered by its victims. The most perfect slaves are,
    therefore, those which blissfully and unawaredly enslave
    themselves. - Dresden James</li>

    <li>I am unable to accept the idea that I should be an obedient
    subject of a gang of corrupt, unprincipled thugs who pontificate
    about freedom while enslaving the population. - John
    Pugsley, JPJ Nov 96</li>

    <li>By the year 2012, projected outlays for entitlements and
    interest on the national debt will consume all tax revenues
    collected by the federal government - There will not be one
    cent left over for education, children's programs, highways,
    national defense, or any other discretionary program. -
    Bipartisan U.S. Commission on Entitlement and Tax Reform</li>

    <li>Christmas is a time when kids tell Santa what they want and
    adults pay for it. Deficits are when adults tell the government
    what they want and their kids pay for it. - Richard
    Lamm, former Gov of Colorado</li>

    <li>A government debt is a government claim against personal
    income and private property - an unpaid tax
    bill. - Hans F. Sennholz, Debts & Deficits</li>

    <li>There is no art which government sooner learns of another
    than that of draining money from the pockets of the
    people. - Adam Smith, Wealth of Nations</li>

    <li>The principle of spending money to be paid by posterity,
    under the name of funding, is but a swindling futurity on a
    large scale. - Thomas Jefferson</li>

    <li>I fear for our nation. Nearly half of our people receive
    some kind of government subsidy. We have grown weak from too
    much affluence and too little adversity. I fear that soon we
    will not be able to defend our country from our sure and certain
    enemies. We have debased our currency to the point that even the
    most loyal citizen no longer trusts it. - A Roman
    Senator in A.D. 63</li>

    <li>The Social Security system did not begin as an attempt to
    sabotage people's ability to plan for retirement, but it has
    worked out that way. The politicians who originally planned the
    system probably had no idea how it would turn out. But today's
    politicians know the system is rotted, and yet they refuse to
    make the changes necessary to free the American people from
    it. Instead, they make it worse. - Ed Clark 1980 LP
    presidential candidate, A New Beginning</li>

    <li>While the feds - leave Social Security off their books, the
    government's obligation to make benefit payments to current and
    near-term Social Security recipients is certainly no less real
    than its obligation to pay interest on its Treasury
    bonds. - Laurence K. Kotlikoff, Harvard Business Review,
    "From Deficit Delusion to Generational Accounting", May-June,
    1993</li>
