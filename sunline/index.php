  <h2>A run in with Sunline Energy</h2>

  <p>So I'm looking at buying a house and I'm concerned with its roof. It seems customary
  to get 3 roof inspections and I decided to use Sunline Engery for one of them. They
  were highly rated in yelp - 348 reviews and an average of 5 stars. But as we can see below
  that may be because Matt scares off anybody who gives a negative review.</p>

  <p>So I had Sunline Energy come out to give me an estimate of a roof on a house that
  I'm in the process of buying. The guy, Jacob Smith, came out and we spoke for a while.
  I mentioned that I didn't think the seller would replace the roof but rather just offer
  a credit. This seemed to irk Jacob because he didn't think this would turn out to be a
  job for his company, that it would just be the estimate. Sorry but for all I know the
  sellers may take that estimate and hire your company. Or I may hire your company down
  the road too. The point is you should provide the estimate, not a text message.</p>

  <p>He said that they take the satellite images to do the inspection so they don't risk
  breaking any of the concrete tiles. I didn't know satellite images were that detailed.
  Jacob said he would email me with the results.</p>

  <p>Instead, he simply texts me a number. Well, this was not what I was expecting and I had
  to call/text him and insist that I get a proper report.</p>

  <p>I had also called the main number of Sunline Energy and asked if this was how they
  regularly do this. The guy didn't seem to know the SOP of his own company.</p>

  <p>Eventually, I got the report in the report in my email but I don't like having to pull
  teeth and play the part of the angry customer when this all should have been simply
  handled professionally  in the first place!</p>

  <p>So the owner, Matt, 858-977-2408, calls me up and argues with me for 10 minutes and
  threatens to call the listing agent supposedly to say "Ah the roof is fine" unless I
  remove this review. He must be trying to sabotage my negotiations as I can see no other
  reason for the owner of Sunline to call the agent. Surely he's not calling them to say
  that the roof needs replacing. Feel free to call him up and ask why he's doing this.</p>

  <p>What a slimeball! Let's see what other rating sites I can spread this message to...</p>

  <p>Yelp may decide to have this review taken down however it will live forever on my
  server at https://defaria.com/sunline.</p>

  </p>Meantime, Matt,  this vindictive prick purchased the doamin andrewdefaria.com, probably to bad
    mouth me in some what so be certain to watch <a href="https://andrewdefaria.com">https://andrewdefaria.com</a> 
    to see what garbage this guy puts up. (Site's currently down - let's see if Matt can get it up?).
    I wonder if he'll spent $381.15 to have somebody else set up the site like he did
    <a href="https://www.created1978.com/projects/invoices/sunline-energy/SE-130110.html">here</a>.
    Meantime, ask yourself if you really and to be doing business with a vindictive prick
    like this? Me? I merely asked for a fucking roof estimate when this guy's company
    started dicking me around.</p>

    </p>You can message Mark Margolin on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/matt-margolin-08915750/">LinkedIn</a>!

    <p>Not a graet review from Mark G. <a href="https://www.bbb.org/us/ca/san-diego/profile/solar-energy-design/sunline-energy-inc-1126-172003675">here</a>.
    Apparently Matt has a habit of taking out things on his customers!</p>
